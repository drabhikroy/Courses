# Welcome! 

Data collection is a must in every evaluation. This slideshow will give you a compact primer and/or reminder of all things basic research methods.

# Crafting a Design: The Framework

--

Here you select an evaluation model, approach, etc. or develop your own synthesis/integration of others. Ask yourself the following when thinking of your choice

--

+ **Who** is likely to know what you are interested in?  How can you represent various groups of participants?

--

+ **What** particular aspects of the program are you interested in (criteria, issues)?  What kinds of data relate to your questions/issues?

--

+ **Where** do relevant activities occur?  If you can’t directly observe it, where is it reflected?

--

+ **When** do relevant activities occur?  When should you collect data?

--

+ **How** can you explore the phenomena in ways that accommodate both your needs and stakeholder needs? Consider your resources and constraints. Be realistic.

---

# Activity Part 1 

Think about the criteria, standards, potential indicators and/or issues you may come across in an evaluation - possibly even one you or your group are considering.

--

&gt; *Start with a brainstorm*. List as many as possible without worrying about whether they are feasible

--

&gt; *Prioritize your brainstorm*. Rank those most likely to reveal program quality at the top of the list

--

&gt; *Retain your brainstorm*. Keep your list because you will use it later

#  Good Questions Are…	 


.pull-left[
+ Carefully worded – the wording determines how a participant will respond

+ Open-ended – avoid forcing responses (How satisfied are you… v.s. Describe how you feel about…)

+ Neutral – don’t lead (Describe what makes this program successful v.s. Describe your perceptions of this program.)

+ Singular – avoid “double-barreled” (How do you feel about this program *and* the way it is administered?)

+ Clear – use language your participants use.

+ Relevant to the central issues you want to explore – be parsimonious, value their time.
]

---

#  Good protocols… 

&gt; + ...include questions to elicit descriptive demographic information (age, education, family configuration, relevant experiences, etc.) if necessary and relevant

&gt; + ...are thoughtfully ordered
    + Getting to know your participants, their experiences
    + Easing them into the research event
    + Sequencing to build trust in order to elicit their opinions, feelings
    + Sequencing to maintain interest

&gt; + ...are of a reasonable length - 8 to 10 substantive questions is often a 45 minute to hour-long interview

&gt; + ...remind you of the critical elements you may need to probe for

&gt; + ...include a variety of types of questions

&gt; + ...close by giving control over the interview to your participants (Is there anything I haven’t asked about that you think I should know?)

---

# Early Days in the Field

--

+ Anxiety is a good thing: &lt;i&gt;Is what you’re doing “right”?&lt;/i&gt;

--

+ Don’t force yourself in – look for easy access.

--

+ Where are the open places?

--

+ How can you get into the closed places?

--

+ Be wary of ordered permission – it isn’t a proper invitation.

--

+ Follow the contextual schedule – be as unobtrusive as possible.

--

+ Don’t assume you don’t know anything, but do assume you don’t know everything. Use what you do know to learn more.

---

# ***Taking*** Notes

---

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
+ Be unobtrusive – situate yourself carefully.

--

+ With a team divide up the setting.

--

+ Use a small pad or folded paper to take notes.

--

+ Practice looking, listening, writing and keeping written lines separate.

--

+ Detail, detail, detail – not good grammar and sentence structure.

--

+ Jot down key words to jog your memory later.

--

+ Keep a card with you or a guide that helps you focus on the things most important in the observation – but note other things, too.

---

&lt;br&gt;

+ Continuous scripting – stopping sends the message “that’s not important” or you’re “looking for something.”

--

+ Be aware of everything!

--

+ Attend to figure-ground. Go wide then narrow your focus.

--

+ Keep track of yourself, your interpretations or reactions in brackets - Evaluator’s awareness of self. You can be judgmental here!

--

+ Keep track of the time.

--

+ Use all of your senses.

--

+ When recording conversations try to capture first, middle and last words. Listen for key words. Develop a shorthand. Verbatim quote “&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“

--

+ Close, not exact ‘&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‘

--

+ Missed something &amp;#95;&amp;#95;&amp;#95;&amp;#95;&amp;#95;, fill in the blanks ASAP.

--

+ Quote people all the time!  What was said, how was it said?  If something is said prior to the observation event, include that in your notes.

--

+ At minimum summarize what seems to be idle talk.

---

# ***Cooking*** Notes 

--

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
+ Begin cooking raw notes ASAP – fill in the blanks before you leave the scene

--

+ Finish cooking ASAP, preferably immediately after event, but at least the same day– memory fades quickly and multiple observations tend to bleed together

--

+ Be concrete.  Distinguish verbatim accounts from paraphrasing and general recall.

--

+ Work at the lowest possible level of inference

---

##  Good ***Cooked*** Notes Include...

--

+ Mapping (drawn or descriptive) - Capture the physical setting, social arrangements.

--

+ Descriptive, but not judgmental language.

--

+ Excruciating, mundane detail.

--

+ Visualization

--

+ Sensory experience

--

+ Presence of self

--

+ Presence of others

--

+ Context

--

+ Figure-ground

--

+ *Notes on Notes*

---

## What the &amp;#8727;&amp;#8727;&amp;#8727;&amp;#8727; are *Notes on Notes*?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
+ Your “hunches” and preliminary analyses - *How will you follow up?*

--

+ Your subjective feelings - *Why do you feel that way?*

--

+ Contrary analysis by asking *Are you being biased or avoiding certain questions?*

--

+ Clearly bracket these so you know what is true field notes vs. what is notes on notes.

---

#  Finding Documents 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&gt; **First** begin with the public – work toward the private. Gaining access to documents follows the same path as establishing rapport with participants – the deeper the rapport, the more private documents you’ll have access to.

--

&gt; **Then** rely on your guiding questions / issues, questions that emerge during data collection and data analysis, and your “hunches” to make decisions about what to look for and what to analyze.

---

#  Types of Documents

]

---

#  Limitations 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&gt; Information may be incomplete or may not line up neatly with your evaluation questions and issues.

&gt; Sampling may be unrepresentative – documents produced by one group may not be produced by another group.

&gt; May be difficult to establish authenticity, accuracy, biases.

---

# Establishing the Provenance

--

+ Ask about the history of the document – when was it produced, where has it been archived?

--

+ Consider how you obtained the document – who gave it to you, why did they give it to you?

--

+ Is the document legitimate, authentic, accurate?

--

+ What are the circumstances of the document’s production – why was it produced, who produced it, when was it produced (historical context)?

--

+ What informed the document’s production – a firsthand account, a secondhand account, a reconstruction, an interpretation

--

+ Consider possible biases and their impact on the document

--

+ Are there other documents that may help you verify the legitimacy, authenticity or accuracy of the document?

---

#  Activity Part 2

+ For several items near the top consider what existing data there is that you are aware of AND specific ways you might collect data
  
+ Think about how far down the list you might feasibly go for your course project
