This section contains materials to help you understand concepts covered for a given week. Sometimes this just consists of additional information while other times there are R walkthroughs.

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30){target="_blank"} or contact me within [Slack](https://2021edp693g.slack.com){target="_blank"} by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
