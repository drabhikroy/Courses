This section will let you know what you have to do after a current class ends and what you have to do before the next class begins. Given that, you should still complete optional tasks as well  because those items will still be assessed at some point.

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts) or contact me within [Slack](https://2021edp613.slack.com) by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
