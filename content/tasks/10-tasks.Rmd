### Literature Review Task

Your fourth literature review task is due in *one week*. Please head over to the [L4: The First Draft](/deliverables/04-l4/) page for more information.

### Create a Draft Survey

1. To receive credit, this step has be completed by <b>Sunday</b> at <b>11:59 PM</b>. Building off of the in-class session, complete a draft survey in [Qualtrics](https://wvu.qualtrics.com/) in your group, turn on [question numbers](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-builder/survey-options-new-survey-builder/#DisplayingQuestionNumbers), and then send it to the remaining groups for pilot testing. You may either send personal links or create a generic address. In either case, use [`#in-class-materials`](https://2022edp612.slack.com/archives/C031W042DB2) to get the class roster or to post your link.

2. To receive credit, this step has be completed by <b>by Tuesday</b> at <b>4:00 PM</b> and you must attend class on time. Individually review the other surveys on and create notes before class time. Use question numbers and provide feedback by item as needed and in order. Hold on to these as we will compile them in class.
