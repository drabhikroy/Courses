## Keeping Up

There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general guidelines:

1.  Engaging with the readings and materials;
2.  Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed;
3.  Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.

## Complementary Materials

Resources such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc. take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Do the materials have top notch production value? No because I’m not a famous director from Hollywood will millions of dollars. However they should be good enough…even decent. Given that, I am always open to suggestions so if you have any, send them along!

## Deliverables

Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities that are incremental and intended to expand and refine your skill set culminating in set of final products[^1]. You are free to submit as a <span style="color:#12b8ff;font-weight: bold;">.docx</span> or <span style="color:#f47a7b;font-weight: bold;">.pdf</span> format. *Remember that all submissions must be in a standard APA 7th edition formatting barring the need for a running header.*
