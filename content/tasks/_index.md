## Keeping Up

There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:

1.  Engaging with the readings and materials;
2.  Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed;
3.  Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.

## Incremental Deliverables

Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in a final product[^1]. Please include your name and submit all documents in either a <span style="color:#12b8ff;font-weight: bold;">.docx</span> or <span style="color:#f47a7b;font-weight: bold;">.pdf</span> format.

<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.
