## Doing

### Teams

It is time to start thinking about getting an evaluation team together. These are groups of 3-4 people that will work with each other through the entire real world evaluations that will be conducted in the course. 

Head to the channel <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04K5T45YDQ" target="_blank" style='color:#5eb0e5;'>#wk2-talk-about-logistics</a> discussion board and post timeslots you might be available to engage in group chat room discussions on a weekly basis. Read through othersâ€™ postings to find people who you could potentially be in a group with. You will have until the end of Week 3 to finalize your group membership. Instructions on how to accomplish this will be posted next week.

For a look at what to consider when choosing teammates, take a look at [a] [Manager's guide to evaluation](https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/managers_guide) by *Jane Davidson*.

### Survey

Please take and complete the survey ***Considering Program Evaluation*** that has been sent to your e-mail. *Please fill it out truthfully as there is no right or wrong answer!* This is just an initial assessment of what you may or may not know or be aware of within the field of evaluation and provides me with an initial benchmark for the class.
