```{r icontibble, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
book <- tibble(
  
  chapter <- c("3"),
  
  exercises <- c("1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11"),
  
  problems <- c("Social Statistics for a Diverse Society"),
  
  pages <- c("75-97"),
  
  .name_repair = "minimal"
  
)
```

### Solutions

*Posted after class day and time next week.*

<p>

a. The mode is <span class="boxed">Routine</span>.

b. The median is <span class="boxed">Routine</span>.

c. Based on the mode and median for this variable, most respondents indicate that their lives are <span class="boxed">Routine</span>.

d. <span class="boxed">A mean score is nonsense for nominal measurements</span>.

</p>

<p>

a. The is <span class="boxed">ordinal</span>.

b. By using either figure related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is <span class="boxed">strongly agree</span>.

c. By using either related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is *strongly agree* for both years this indicating a high level of support. When combined *agree*,  more than half of the 2014 (32.5% + 25.3% = 57.5%) and (39.5% + 27.0% = 66.5%) 2018 GSS samples agree that homosexuals should have the right to marry.

a. This has a level of an <span class="boxed">interval-ratio</span>. Using frequencies^[You can also do this using cumulative percentages.], we have
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{N+1}{2}&= \dfrac{32+1}{2}\\\\
&= 16.5
\end{aligned}
Adding up the frequencies until locating the 16th and 17th cases yields the category <span class="boxed">40 hr worked last week</span>.


b. We have 

- 25th percentile = $(32 × 0.25)$ implying the 8th case, or <span class="boxed">30 hr worked last week</span>.
- 50th percentile is simply the median implying the category <span class="boxed">40 hr worked last week</span>.
- 75th percentile = $(32 × 0.75)$ implying the 24th case, or <span class="boxed">40 hr worked last week</span>.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>4</summary>
<p>

a. The mode category is <span class="boxed">agree</span>.

b. Using frequencies, we find that the median is 2, or <span class="boxed">agree</span>.

c. 

- 20th percentile = $(835 × 0.20)$ implying the 167th case, or <span class="boxed">strongly agree</span>.
- 80th percentile = $(835 × 0.80)$ implying the 668th case, or <span class="boxed">agree</span>.

a. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
dt <- tibble(
  Text_1 = c("Black", "Hispanic", "White"),
  Text_2 = c("Seldom", "Everyday", "Everyday"),
  Text_3 = c("Sometimes", "Nearly everyday", "Most days")
)
```

<center>

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(dt, 
      align = c('l', 'l', 'l'), 
      col.names = c("Race", "Mode", "Median") 
      ) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center",
                full_width = FALSE) 
```

</center>

b. Teens’ breakfast habits vary by race/ethnicity. Out of the three racial/ethnic groups, Black students were more likely to report seldom or sometimes eating breakfast. On the other hand, White and Hispanic students eat breakfast more frequently. The <span class="boxed">mode</span> for White and Hispanic students is everyday. 
</p>

<details><summary>6</summary>
<p>

The mode for both Males and Females is <span class="boxed">Working full-time</span>. 

Using frequencies, we have

- Males: 
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{N+1}{2}&= \dfrac{596+1}{2}\\\\
&= 298.5
\end{aligned}
Adding up the frequencies until locating the 298th and 299th cases yields the category <span class="boxed">Working Full Time</span>.

- Females: 
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{N+1}{2}&= \dfrac{781+1}{2}\\\\
&= 391
\end{aligned}
Adding up the frequencies until locating the 391th case yields the category <span class="boxed">Working Full Time</span>. Using either the mode or median implies that there are <span class="boxed">no substantial differences between males and females</span>.

</p>

<details><summary>10</summary>
<p>

a. \
```{r echo=FALSE , message=FALSE}
read_csv(here("static", "data", "homeworks", "ch3p10.csv")) %>% kable(align = c('l', "c", "c"), 
      col.names = c("Hours Worked Last Week", "Frequency", "Hours Worked Last Week x Frequency") 
      ) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center",
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(c(14), bold = T, color = "white", background = "#559e83")
```

so we have 
\begin{aligned}
\overline{Y}&=\dfrac{1250}{32}\\\\
&\approx 39.06
\end{aligned}
or about <span class="boxed">39 hours</span>.

b. Since the median was 40 hr worked last week, the distribution is slightly <span class="boxed">skewed in a positive direction</span>.

<p>
Since Clinton and Sanders’ middle-class income amount is higher than the U.S. Census estimated mean or median, their definition of middle class is not based on the statistical middle. It is unclear what they were using but it was not based on the actual measure.
