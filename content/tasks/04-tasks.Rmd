## Refine the Draft

This task involves a multi-step process to update your instrument^[In the case where a new variant needs to be created, please remember to share it with me.] If you do not intent to administer your instrument electronically, submit a one page narrative describing your intended sampling frame (population, sample, and setting) and how you intend to reach said participants. Please attach your instrument to the submission.

1. Open your working copy from the previous week

2. Create a five column table with the following headers
    ```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    ex <- tibble(
      
      index = c(NA),
      
      item = c(NA),
      
      measure = c(NA),
      
      group = c(NA),
  
      changes = c("")
       
    ) 
    ```
    
    <center>
    ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    ex %>%
      drop_na() %>%
      kbl("html", 
      escape = FALSE) %>%
      kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, 
                    font_size = 22,
                    html_font = "roboto condensed") %>% 
      row_spec(0, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;font-weight: 600;text-decoration:underline', color = "#f7f7f7", background = "transparent") 
    ```
    </center>
    where the<br><br> 
      a. <span style="font-weight:600; color:#f7f7f7; text-decoration:underline;font_size = 22;">index</span> is an item number given in order of appearance
      
      b. <span style="font-weight:600; color:#f7f7f7; text-decoration:underline;font_size = 22;">item</span> is a statement or question
      
      c. <span style="font-weight:600; color:#f7f7f7; text-decoration:underline;font_size = 22;">measure</span> is the associated measure
      
      d. <span style="font-weight:600; color:#f7f7f7; text-decoration:underline;font_size = 22;">group</span> is the associated group of items, if applicable
      
      e. <span style="font-weight:600; color:#f7f7f7; text-decoration:underline;font_size = 22;">group</span> is a brief description of any alterations performed, if applicable<br><br>
