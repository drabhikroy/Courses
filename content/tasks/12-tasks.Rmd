### Solutions

*Posted after class day and time next week.*

*Note: To stay consistent with the general literature, the* $\chi^2$ *value obtained will be referenced by the variable* $\chi^2_{obt}$.

a. We have 
\begin{align}
df &= (3-1)\cdot(2-1)\\
   &= 2
\end{align}
yielding <span class="boxed">2 degrees of freedom</span>.

b. We have $\chi^2 = 3.311$. With $\chi^2_{obt} =  0.191 > \alpha = 0.01$, <span class="boxed">we fail to reject $H_0$ and conclude that sex and opinion of whether or not people can be trusted are likely independent</span>. Specifically, similar percentages of men ($34.94$%) and women ($29.7$%) felt that people can be trusted.

c. If $\alpha = 0.05$, $\chi^2_{obt} =  0.191$ would still be greater and thus <span class="boxed">we would still reject $H_0$</span>.

d. We have $\lambda = 0.000$ implying that there <span class="boxed">is no proportional reduction of error using sex to predict whether or not people can be trusted</span>.

a. There does not appear to be a relationship between gender and views on restoring the voting rights of felons in prison. $30$% of respondents supported restoring the voting rights of felons in prison, with only a slightly greater percentage of men ($31$%) reporting such compared to women ($28$%).

a. <span class="boxed">A higher percentage of White respondents ($38.14$%), compared to Black respondents ($23$%), reported that people could be trusted</span>.

b. <span class="boxed">For Black respondents, a slightly higher percentage of men ($15.1$%) compared to women ($12.5$%) reported that people could be trusted</span>.

c. For 
- Whites with $\chi^2 = 2.395$, <span class="boxed">we fail to reject $H_0$.</span>
- Blacks with $\chi^2 = 0.233$, <span class="boxed">we fail to reject $H_0$</span>.
It is also worth noting that two of the cells have expected counts less than 5 so results should be cautiously interpreted. It would likely be beneficial to repeat the study with a larger sample size.

a. <span class="boxed">We will make 2,973 errors</span> since we predict that all victims fall in the modal category (White) where
\begin{align}
E_1 &= 6084 – 3111\\
   &= 2973
\end{align}

b. For 
- White offenders, we could make <span class="boxed">373 errors</span>
- Black offenders, we could make <span class="boxed">493 errors</span>
- Other offenders, we would make <span class="boxed">42 errors</span> given $E_2 = 908$. 

c.	The proportional reduction in error is then 
\begin{align}
\dfrac{2973 – 908}{2973} & \approx 0.6946
\end{align}
This indicates a very strong relationship between the two variables. <span class="boxed">We can reduce the error in predicting victim’s race based upon race of offender by 69.46%</span>.

Though males contribute to more violent onset, in proportional terms, females exhibit a higher prevalence rate, in that $18.32$% of females exhibit violent onset compared with $11.71$% of males. 

- Age at first offense, the model is significant at the $0.01 \alpha$ level, <span class="boxed">indicating a likely significant relationship between age at first offense and violent onset</span>. Violent onset is more likely among the group 14 years and older ($14.74$%) than those less than 14 years of age at first onset ($9.67$%).
