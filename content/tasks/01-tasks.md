### Class Slack Account Access
Please sign up for Slack!

1. You will receive an invite for the class [Slack](2022edp612.slack.com) account
2. Register if you already do not have an account. Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea.
3. Head to to the channel <font face="Arial Narrow" size="4px">`#introduce-yourself`</font> and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me:
<br>
<br>
*I teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind!*
<br>
<br>
4. (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!

### Verify Qualtrics Account Login
You may end up using a survey in this course so its a good idea to go to the [WVU Qualtrics login page](https://wvu.qualtrics.com) and simply make sure you can login. If you are unable to do so, please submit a [ticket to IT](https://wvu.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1976/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=9102) or give them a ring at <a href="tel:3042934444">304-293-4444</a> as soon as possible.

### Begin CITI Ethics Training
Completion of all necessary [CITI modules](https://human.research.wvu.edu/get-started/training/citi-ethics-training) is not only mandated, but if you conduct research in any capacity and are not certified consequences can be dire including receiving jail time. The Ethics Training is an educational program to teach you about the protection of human subjects in research. In this course, you are required to complete the <b>Social & Behavioral Research Investigators Basic Course</b>. Use the link given above to get registered. Completion of the entire set is due in **one month**. You can upload a copy of the completion certificate to [eCampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu/) at any time.
