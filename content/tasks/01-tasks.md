## Slack

### Class Channel

1.  Check your email for an invite to the course <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack channel</a>. **If you registered for the course after the first day, please send me an email requesting an invitation**.
2.  Register if you do not already have an account. You certainly do not have to use your WVU email, but its not a bad idea just in case any future classes use the platform.
3.  Head to to the channel <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04J0EWTK9Q" target="_blank" style='color:#ff8384;'>\#wk1-introduce-yourself</a> and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about you, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me:<br><br>
    *I teach course on data visualization BUT I am also 40% colorblind and getting worse!* <br><br>
4.  (optional) Pleased provide a picture if you are willing!

## Drawing Evaluations

Get a blank piece of paper and writing utensil or use a computer program to draw a picture of the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “Evaluation”. Think about what that picture means to you and then write a short narrative describing the picture you drew and explaining why you think that was the picture that first came to your mind in relation to *Evaluation*. Post the digital image, scanned copy, or a picture of your drawing to <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04J2V6A30C" target="_blank" style='color:#ff8384;'>\#wk-1-pictures-of-evaluation</a> on Slack.
