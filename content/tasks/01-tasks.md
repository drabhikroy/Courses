### Class Slack Account Access

1.  Go to the course [Slack](https://edp611summer2022.slack.com) account
2.  Register if you already do not have an account. Note that you do not have to use your WVU email, but its not a bad idea just in case any future classes use the platform.
3.  Head to to the channel <span style="font-size:20px">[#wk1-introduce-yourself](https://edp611summer2022.slack.com/archives/C03FC1NUW0N)</span> and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about you, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me:<br><br>
    *I teach course on data visualization BUT I am also 40% colorblind and getting worse!* <br><br>
4.  (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!

### Verify Qualtrics Account Login

## Think about assessment

Since your final product for the course is a proposal grounded in proper and effective measures, we will work on a weekly basis to get you there. For this week, please construct a one paragraph case for a population that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitatively driven. Submit this document using APA 7th Edition formatting to [eCampus](%22https://ecampus.wvu.edu/%22).

The entire sequence leading up to the final proposal can be found on the [main Tasks page](/tasks/#final-proposal).

## First Meetup

We will meet on a weekly basis throughout the entirety of the course. While there is always a certain amount of assessment within each meeting, the purpose of each session is not to trap you in a corner, but rather to address the weekly tasks, answer any content or R related questions, or just to give you the space to vent. If you come to every meeting having gone through the material and with questions/reflections, these short one-on-ones will be engaging and likely helpful. With that said, you are free to schedule a session with either of the instructors:

> [Dr. Roy’s calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short15)

> [Carinna Ferguson’s calendar](https://calendly.com/carinna-ferguson/611)
