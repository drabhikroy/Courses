### Literature Review Task

Your fifth literature review task is due in *two weeks*. Please head over to the [L5: The Second Draft](/deliverables/05-l5/) page for more information.

### Administer a Draft Survey

1. To receive credit, this step has be completed by <b>next Tuesday</b> at <b>11:59 PM</b>. Building off of the in-class session, administer your draft survey in [Qualtrics](https://wvu.qualtrics.com/) to a list of respondents. Recall the entire point of this exercise is to collect enough data to perform some analyses next week.

2. Make sure you send out at least one reminder and leave the survey open until Monday evening at 11:59 PM.

### Get Started with R

Begin to go through the entire DataCamp module <i>[Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)</i>. 

This assessment covers the following chapters:
- Intro to basics
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Factors
- Data frames
- Lists

While not due for two weeks, it is highly recommended that you start on this as it may take you awhile. You will be expected to have R and RStudio installed and ready to go and have some basics ideas on how to input syntax before the start of class.

Note: 

- If you do not have a DataCamp account, then you will have to register. I suggest using your WVU email just in case you are assigned any DataCamp modules in another class. 

- If you do have an existing DataCamp account and have completed the module listed above, then there is no need to do it again.

Regardless of account status, all students must submit a [statement of accomplishment](https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005885114-Where-can-I-download-my-statement-of-accomplishment-) to [eCampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu) as proof of completion. <b>Please note that late submissions are NOT accepted for this task.</b>
