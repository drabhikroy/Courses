## Writing

### Posting

Evaluations administered within the context of a class are almost never *participatory* simply due to a lack of time and given a semi-controlled environment. However in practice, at least half require or mandate some level of participation within the evaluative process.

Given that, the level of stakeholder/sponsor involvement in the planning, execution, and reporting of a study may have an effect on its efficacy and utility. Take a bit to think about the following three items and when youâ€™re ready, address them in a single post on the channel [\#wk9-participatory-evaluations](https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04SEH1CQBW).

Take a look at the figure below and address the items below
+ assess the level of stakeholder/sponsor participation you are comfortable with (horizontal axis)
+ assess the effect on evaluation outcomes based on your choice (vertical axis)
+ choose a label that best represents your position

1.  Interpret and discuss the reason for your selection.

2.  Which stages of the evaluation process would you allow and disallow stakeholder/sponsor involvement, if any? Please defend your position.

3.  Does stakeholder/sponsor involvement in an evaluation affect the integrity of an evaluation? If so, when would this first start to occur? If not, explain why. Please defend your position.

## Doing

### Evaluation Checklists

If you are a checklist type of person, consider taking a look at the many examples at the [*Evaluation Checklist Project*](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists) within the The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University. You can read more about the [validation process](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists/checklistsvalidation) and how to [submit](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists/checklist-submit) one that the project does not have.
