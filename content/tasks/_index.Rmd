## Logistics

### Keeping Up

There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general guidelines:

1. Engaging with the readings and materials;
2. Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed; 
3. Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.

### Complementary Materials 

Resources such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc. take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Do the materials have top notch production value? No because I'm not a famous director from Hollywood will millions of dollars. However they should be good enough...even decent. Given that, I am always open to suggestions so if you have any, send them along!

### Evaluation Teams

You will need to form 2 - 4 member support and project teams There will be a discussion board where you can discuss available times in your schedules for group chats and there will be a group signup tool in Slack^[Available starting week 2 of the course]. Once you have completed sign up, Slack will automatically privatize your team. 

## Weekly Postings
I will create discussion boards for a variety of purposes including discussing general course questions / logistics, getting to know each other, getting organized into groups, discussing each assignment, etc. You will need to participate actively on each board and your postings should be meaningful and incorporate depth. Responses without any additional information and/or justifications will be considered to be incomplete and will reflect on your final earned point value. For further information, please take a look at the description below.

### Writing on Slack
**Remember this is a graduate level class and your writing should reflect that**. Moreover, these postings should be in APA 7th Edition formatting unless otherwise noted. The following general idea will be used when assessing your *initial posts*, but this is not a rubric. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

plus <- as.character(fa("plus", fill = "#5cb85c", height = "25px"))

check <- as.character(fa("check", fill = "#0275d8", height = "25px"))

minus <- as.character(fa("minus", fill = "#f0ad4e", height = "25px"))

not <- as.character(fa("exclamation", fill = "#d9534f", height = "25px"))

empty <- as.character(fa("times", fill = "#8d818f", height = "25px"))

initials <- tibble(
  
  range <- c(plus, 
             check,
             minus, 
             not,
             empty
  ),
  
  worth <- c("<b>11.5</b>",
             "<b>10</b>",
             "<b>5</b>",
             "<b>0</b>",
             "<b>0</b>"),
  
  criteria <- c(
    
    "Posts are well defined that fully address and develop all aspects of the prompt such that they

advance the discussion,<br>
are factually correct,<br>
are cited correctly when necessary, *and*<br>
provide a clear, concise, reflective and substantive contribution",

"Posts are mostly well defined that tend to address all aspects of the prompt such that they

generally advance the discussion,<br>
are factually correct,<br>
are cited correctly when applicable, *but*<br>
lack clarity or full development of the concept(s)",

"Posts are undertsandable but are not cohesive such that they do lack 

clarity *or*<br>
depth *or*<br>
non-repetitiveness *or*<br>
preparedness *or*<br>
justification",

"Posts are generally incoherant or superficial such that they are

repeated *or*<br>
incorrect *or*<br>
irrelevant *or*<br>
off-topic",

"Posts are nonexistent or lack merit"

  ),

.name_repair = "minimal"

)

```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
initials %>%
  kbl(
    col.names = c("Marker", "Point Value", "Criteria"), 
    "html", 
    escape = FALSE,
    align = 'ccl'
  ) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30em") %>% 
  column_spec(1:3, color = "#ffffff") %>%
  row_spec(0:5, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;', color = "#ffffff", background = "transparent") 
```

### Responding on Slack
To keep track of what responses go to which post and to receive credit for your responses, use the option pictured below: ![](/img/lesson/slack_pop_menu.png) For further information, please read over [Reply in thread](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-).

## Synchronous Meetings
There are two types of meetings in this class: *ongoing* and *check-in*. Please see the details below for an explanation of each.

### Ongoing
You will need to meet weekly in the chat room to discuss your understanding, questions, and challenges with the readings, upcoming assignments, etc. I will provide prompts and scaffolding for your discussions. A one page summary consisting of who attended the meeting, content and general synopsis must submitted to eCampus unless otherwise noted.

### Check-ins
We will need to meet at least six (6) times over the course of term. the primary purpose of this is not just to get to know you, but also to answer any questions you may have and to get an idea of what areas need to be addressed. My job is to serve as a mentor during your evaluation but that requires you to ask questions and be up to date on the course material. I will be using terminology that has been covered and without a frame of reference, the conversation may be difficult.

## Deliverables

There are five primary deliverables in the course. Included below are basic descriptions of each but a full set of criteria for each task will be posted as we progress through the term. You are free to submit as a <span style="color:#12b8ff;font-weight: bold;">.docx</span> or <span style="color:#f47a7b;font-weight: bold;">.pdf</span> format. *Remember that all submissions must be in a standard APA 7th edition formatting barring the need for a running header.*
