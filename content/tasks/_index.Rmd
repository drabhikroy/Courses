This section contains descriptions of course tasks. Materials will be posted on a weekly basis. Please note that these pages populate information about course related tasks on the left hand side **when they are assigned**. Due dates are given with the description of each task.

## Keeping Up

There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:

1. Engaging with the readings and materials;
2. Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed; 
3. Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.


## General Course Makeup

### Weekly Postings
I will create discussion boards for a variety of purposes including discussing general course questions / logistics, getting to know each other, getting organized into groups, discussing the [readings](/readings/), etc. You will need to participate actively on each board and your postings should be meaningful and incorporate depth. Responses without any additional information and/or justifications will be considered to be incomplete and will reflect on your final earned point value. For further information, please take a look at the description below.


#### Writing on Slack

**Remember this is a graduate level class and your writing should reflect that**. Moreover, these postings should be in APA 7th Edition formatting unless otherwise noted. The following general idea will be used when assessing your *initial posts*, but this is not a rubric. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

plus <- as.character(fa("plus", fill = "#5cb85c", height = "25px"))

check <- as.character(fa("check", fill = "#0275d8", height = "25px"))

minus <- as.character(fa("minus", fill = "#f0ad4e", height = "25px"))

not <- as.character(fa("exclamation", fill = "#d9534f", height = "25px"))

empty <- as.character(fa("times", fill = "#8d818f", height = "25px"))

initials <- tibble(
  
  range <- c(plus, 
             check,
             minus, 
             not,
             empty
  ),
  
  worth <- c("<b>11.5</b>",
             "<b>10</b>",
             "<b>5</b>",
             "<b>0</b>",
             "<b>0</b>"),
  
  criteria <- c(
    
    "Posts are well defined that fully address and develop all aspects of the prompt such that they

advance the discussion,<br>
are factually correct,<br>
are cited correctly when necessary, *and*<br>
provide a clear, concise, reflective and substantive contribution",

"Posts are mostly well defined that tend to address all aspects of the prompt such that they

generally advance the discussion,<br>
are factually correct,<br>
are cited correctly when applicable, *but*<br>
lack clarity or full development of the concept(s)",

"Posts are undertsandable but are not cohesive such that they do lack 

clarity *or*<br>
depth *or*<br>
non-repetitiveness *or*<br>
preparedness *or*<br>
justification",

"Posts are generally incoherant or superficial such that they are

repeated *or*<br>
incorrect *or*<br>
irrelevant *or*<br>
off-topic",

"Posts are nonexistent or lack merit"

  ),

.name_repair = "minimal"

)

```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
initials %>%
  kbl(
    col.names = c("Marker", "Point Value", "Criteria"), 
    "html", 
    escape = FALSE,
    align = 'ccl'
  ) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30em") %>% 
  column_spec(1:3, color = "#ffffff") %>%
  row_spec(0:5, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;', color = "#ffffff", background = "transparent") 
```
</center>

#### Responding on Slack
To keep track of what responses go to which post and to receive credit for your responses, use the option pictured below: ![](/img/reference/slack_pop_menu.png) For further information, please read over [Reply in thread](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-).

### Synchronous Meetings
There are two types of meetings in this class: *ongoing* and *check-in*. Please see the details below for an explanation of each.

#### Ongoing
You will need to meet weekly in the chat room to discuss your understanding, questions, and challenges with the readings, upcoming assignments, etc. I will provide prompts and scaffolding for your discussions. A one page summary consisting of who attended the meeting, content and general synopsis must submitted to eCampus unless otherwise noted.

#### Check-in
We will need to meet at least once a week over the course of term. the primary purpose of this is not just to get to know you, but also to answer any questions you may have and to get an idea of what areas need to be addressed. My job is to address questions and provide feedback but that also requires you to ask questions and be up to date on the material. I will be using terminology that has been covered and without a frame of reference, the conversation may be difficult.

## Proposal

Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project^[These will ***not*** be graded using a check system. If you've engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.]. Please include your name and submit all documents in either a <span style="color:#12b8ff;font-weight: bold;">.docx</span> or <span style="color:#f47a7b;font-weight: bold;">.pdf</span> format.

<div id="anchorwk1"> 
<details><summary>Week 1: Think about assessment.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population^[A population does not necessarily refer to people.] that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk2">
<details><summary>Week 2: Create an argument. </summary>
<br>
<p>
Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used. 
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk3">
<details><summary>Week 3. Develop a draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Create a draft of your instrument^[If the instrument is housed elsewhere (e.g. Qualtrics), then simply provide a link and ensure that access is granted to me.] by whatever medium you choose. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible. 
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk4">
<details><summary>Week 4. Refine the draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for a simulation of responses.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk5">
<details><summary>Week 5. Test for validity and reliability.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Simulate data and then conduct an EFA to assess validity and a reliability analysis.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk6">
<details><summary>Week 6. Revise and resubmit.</summary>
<br>
<p>
After amending, create an elevator pitch, supplemental abstract and a final version of your instrument.
</p>
</details>
</div>
