## Evaluation Teams
You will need to form 2 - 4 member support and project teams There will be a discussion board where you can discuss available times in your schedules for group chats and there will be a group signup tool in Slack^[Available starting week 2 of the course]. Once you have completed sign up, Slack will automatically privatize your team. 

## General Deliverables Makeup

### Evaluation Documents
There are four primary deliverables in the course. Included below are basic descriptions of each but a full set of criteria for each task will be posted as we progress through the term.

#### Evaluation Prospectus
A general list and brief descriptions of possible programs to evaluate.

#### Needs Assessment
After identifying a program, your group will be tasked to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group using an approved medium of the primary stakeholder(s) and/or sponsor(s). 

#### Evaluation Proposal
A full proposal of the anticipated evaluation framework including a discussion of the program, its needs, and intended approach/methods.

#### Final Report
A stakeholder or sponsor oriented report of the full evaluation process written to be accessible and appropriate for the intended audience.  

Depending on the program you evaluate and on how you end up conceptualizing your evaluation study, these assignments may be modified in order to make them more meaningful and applicable to your needs and interests. Further details may be found the individual task documents. Never hesitate to discuss any issues you have relative to the assignments with me. More about these task will be posted in the following weeks. 

### Presentation of Results
This task will involve your group presenting on your evaluation. This will be your way of teaching the class about the program your group chose to evaluate and what you learned from conducting your evaluation project.
