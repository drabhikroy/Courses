You will get the most of out this class if you:

1. engage with the readings and materials,
2. use R to complete any [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling){target="_blank"} or analysis,
3. ask for help immediately after giving **it** (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and
4. keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.

Below is a list of items considered to be class related tasks.

## R Training
Details on training modules can be found on the [Data Camp](/datacamp/) page.

## R Projects
You will need to complete two R projects to be submitted in [Rmarkdown](/resources/rmarkdown/). Details about these projects will post approximately three weeks before the due date.

## R Tasks
On most weeks, you will be asked to submit an R related task. These must be turned in by Wednesday at 11:59 PM on the [ecampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu/){target="_blank"} Submission Portal.

## Meetings
Starting after the fourth week, we will need to meet on a biweekly basis to discuss project parameters and to give you an opportunity to ask questions. These sessions are scheduled for 15 minutes but can typically be adjusted if needed.

## Final

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts){target="_blank"} or contact me within [Slack](https://2021edp693g.slack.com){target="_blank"} by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
