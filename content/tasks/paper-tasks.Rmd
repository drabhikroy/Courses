## R markdown formatting

The final report will only be accepted as a PDF output created from an R markdown file. You are free to use the template provided by clicking on the icon below or to  create your own custom version.

<a href="/templates/possible_final_paper_template.zip">
<img src="/logos/rmd-pdf-logo.png" alt=".Rmd and PDF file logos" style="width: 150px;"/>
</a>
</center>

Please note that there is no need to denote the variant in your submission as it will become obvious simply by looking at it. For further information about the R markdown framework and options, some resources are provided below:

1. go through the *optional extra credit* R markdown module on [data.camp](https://datacamp.com/)

2. check out the course section on R markdown in the [Guides](/resources/Rmarkdown/) section

3. review over the R markdown section in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html). For a comprehensive guide to R markdown, take a look at the [R markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/Rmarkdown-cookbook/)

4. use an external resource like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47710427/how-to-show-code-but-hide-output-in-Rmarkdown)

5. reach out for assistance over our course [Slack](https://2021edp693g.slack.com) site


## Paper Submissions

You are required to submit two variants of this task to different outlets. Please read the following carefully and ask questions if needed.

<center>
```{r sub_tab, echo=FALSE}

slackico <- as.character("/logos/slack-ico.png{width=20px}")

wvuico <- as.character("/logos/wvu-blue-ico.png{width=20px}")

tibble(
  
  type <- c("Detailed Report",
            "Cleaned Report"
  ),
  
  description <- c(
    "The entire report with all code chunks, syntax, and corresponding explanations <span style='color:#ac58ff;'>shown</span> as a single PDF",
    "The entire report with all code chunks, syntax and explanations <span style='color:#ff4040;'>hidden</span> as a single PDF"
  ),
  
  submit <- c(
    "PDF as described",
    "PDF as described, `.Rmd` file, & applicable data set(s)^[If you have a protected data set that has been discussed with me, then this can and should be excluded]"
  ),

  link <- c(
    paste0("[![",wvuico,"](/logos/wvu-blue-ico.png 'WVU Blue Icon'){width=30px}]",
    "(https://ecampus.wvu.edu){target='_blank'}"
    ),
     paste0("[![",slackico,"](/logos/slack-ico.png 'Slack Icon'){width=30px}]",
    "(https://2021edp693g.slack.com/final-project

    )
  ),
  
  .name_repair = "minimal"
  
) %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Type of Submission", "Description of Reporting Style", "What to Provide", "Where to Submit^[You may click on the icons to get connected]"), 
      "html", 
      escape = FALSE,
      align = 'lllc') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "50em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30em") %>%
  column_spec(4, 
              width = "10em",
              extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;') %>%
  row_spec(0, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;') 
```
</center>

### Structure

The paper parallels a miniaturized article involving the parts below. Depending on the level of detail in your proposal, parts from that may be directly copied over. This should be written in a third party voice.

```{r paper_parts, echo=FALSE}

tibble(
  
  chunk <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),
  
  section <- c("Introduction",
               "Methods",
               "Analyses",
               "Results",
               "Limitations"),
  
  description <- c("*A* ***brief narrative*** *of your data set including but not limited to its sampling frame, context, history if feasible, and network structure. Please end this section indicating your research question(s).*",
                   "*A* ***detailed narrative*** *outlining the unique need for an SNA and what approach(es) you took to address those. Please do not simply repeat or rehash SNA content such as definitions, methods, etc.; rather describe how each were applied in context, what they were intended to accomplish and why you chose to use them.* ",
                   "*A* ***detailed narrative*** *showing the work you've performed explicitly shown in the code chunks. Each chunk should be preceded by an explanation of what is going on and why you chose to pursue.*",
                   "*A* ***general narrative*** *describing the study outcomes and any conclusions drawn. You need to be specific and tie the results back into the reseasrch question(s)*",
                   "*A* ***brief narrative*** *describing possible next steps in conducting a future SNA predicated on what you have done and found thus far.*"),
  
  .name_repair = "minimal"
  
) %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("", 
                    "Section", 
                    "Description"), 
      "html", 
      escape = FALSE,
      align = 'cll') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "50em")
```

There is a hard submission deadline on December 16 at 11:59 PM due to the short turnaround between finals week and the end of the university grading period. This implies that **late submissions cannot be accepted**.

### Notes

- There is no need to denote the variant in your submission as it will become obvious simply by looking at it

- I highly recommend that you consider performing all of your analyses in a script first and then transferring the appropriate code over to an Rmarkdown file which is generally used for reporting

- These are based on networks, so make sure to include ***multiple visualizations*** to assist with your narrative. These should be include in both variants.
