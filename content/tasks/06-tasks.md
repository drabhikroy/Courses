### Posting

After going through this week’s [readings](/readings/06-readings), address the following items in a single post on the channel <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04PPBD5YFM" target="_blank" style='color:#5eb0e5;'>\#wk6-disagreement</a>

- <i>How did or will you determine the important criterion or criteria from the stakeholder/sponsor interview?</i>

- <i>Recall that you as the evaluator are the expert but a sponsor is often the person who hires and pays you. Given this, what would you do in a situation where you and the sponsor fundamentally disagree with what should be evaluated?</i>

## Doing

### Program Evaluation Standards

Take a look at a list of [standards](https://jcsee.org/program/) that were created by the <i>Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation</i>. You can and should use this list as a barometer to assess if your evaluation would be considered at minimum satisfactory.

### Evaluation Reports

If you’re interested in seeing some ideas on how construct evaluation reports, please take a look at the links below.
