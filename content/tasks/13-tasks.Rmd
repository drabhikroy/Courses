### Solutions

*Posted after the next class session.*

<!--
*Note: The* $z$ *value obtained will be referenced by the variable* $z_{obt}$.

a. We have 
\begin{align}
H_0:\,\mu_Y=13.5\,\,\text{years}\\
H_1:\,\mu_Y<13.5\,\,\text{years}
\end{align}

b. We have 
\begin{align}
z &= \dfrac{10.9-13.5}{7.6/\sqrt{150}}\\[0.5ex]
&\approx -4.19
\end{align}
yielding that $z$ value, or $z_{obt} = -4.19$. The $p$-value for this $z_{obt} < 0.001$ for a one-tailed test where $\alpha = 0.01$. Since $z_{obt} < 0.001$ and $0.001 < \alpha$, we <span class="boxed">reject $H_0$ and can likely assume that the doctors at the HMO do have less experience than the population of doctors at all HMOs.</span>

<p>
a. We have  
\begin{align}
s_{p_1-p_2} &=\sqrt{\dfrac{0.43\cdot(1-0.43)}{899}+\dfrac{0.50\cdot(1-0.50)}{351}}\\[0.5ex]
&= \sqrt{0.0313}\\
&\approx 0.03
\end{align}
implying 
\begin{align}
z &= \dfrac{0.43-0.50}{0.03}\\[0.5ex]
&\approx -2.33
\end{align}
so $z_{obt} = -2.33$ and the probability of obtaining this $z$ statistic is $0.0099\cdot 2=0.0198$ which is less than $\alpha = 0.01$. So we <span class="boxed">reject $H_0$ and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Hispanic Americans. In fact given we have $0.43-0.50=-0.07$, there is a lower proportion of home ownership among first-generation Hispanic Americans than second-generation Hispanic Americans</span>.

b. We have  
\begin{align}
s_{p_1-p_2} &=\sqrt{\dfrac{0.58\cdot(1-0.58)}{2684}+\dfrac{0.51\cdot(1-0.51)}{566}}\\[0.5ex]
&= \sqrt{0.0229}\\
&\approx 0.02
\end{align}
implying 
\begin{align}
z &= \dfrac{0.58-0.51}{0.02}\\[0.5ex]
&\approx 3.50
\end{align}
so $z_{obt} = 3.50$ and the probability of obtaining this $z$ statistic is $0.002\cdot 2=0.0004$ which is less than $\alpha = 0.01$. So we <span class="boxed">reject $H_0$ and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Asian Americans. In fact given we have $0.58-0.51=0.07$, there is a higher proportion of home ownership among first-generation Hispanic Americans than second-generation Hispanic Americans</span>.

a. We have 
\begin{align}
H_0:\,\pi_1=\pi_2\\
H_1:\,\pi_1<\pi_2
\end{align}

b. We have 
\begin{align}
s_{p_1-p_2} &=\sqrt{\dfrac{0.34\cdot(1-0.34)}{1799}+\dfrac{0.41\cdot(1-0.41)}{1001}}\\[0.5ex]

&\approx 0.02
\end{align}
implying
\begin{align}
z &= \dfrac{0.34-0.41}{0.02}\\[0.5ex]
&\approx -3.50
\end{align}
yielding that <span class="boxed">$z_{obt}=-3.50 <\alpha = 0.05$</span> (and less than $0.0002$ from Appendix A). So <span class="boxed">the proportion of White respondents who support the tactic of bringing people of different racial backgrounds together to talk about race is lower than the proportion of Black respondents</span>. The difference given by $0.41-0.34$ is likely significant at the $0.05$ level.

a. We have

H_0:\,\mu = 37.8\\
H_1:\,\mu\neq 37.8
\end{align}

b. We have 
\begin{align}
t &= \dfrac{48.69-37.80}{17.99/\sqrt{1495}}\\[0.5ex]

\end{align}
yielding that <span class="boxed">$t_{obt}=23.17$</span> with <span class="boxed">$p < 0.001$</span> (and is greater than $3.291$ from Appendix B). 

c. We can say that $H_0$ should likely be rejected in favor of the $H_1$. So <span class="boxed">there is a difference between the mean age of the GSS sample and the mean age of all American adults</span>. Relative to age, the GSS sample is not representative of all American adults (the GSS sample is significantly older).
