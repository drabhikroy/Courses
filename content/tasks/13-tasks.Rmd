## Writing

### Responses

Using the experience within the scope of your evaluation, please create **one response** for <a href="https://edp617spring2023.slack.com/archives/C04Q9H31BMM" target="_blank" style='color:#ff8384;'>#wk9-participatory-evaluations</a> on Slack<sup>1</sup> using the following criteria

1. Decide if you label has changed
2. Choose a posting where the label posted by a peer differs from your current choice
3. Compare and contrast their label with yours

*Note that it is absolutely fine to both praise and critique points as long as yours are justified with evidence-based resources.*

## Doing 

### Evaluation Budgets and Contracts

If you are interested in possibly conducting evaluations for additional income, please take a look at the link below

```{r echo=FALSE}
zip_link <- function() {
 paste0("<a href='/handouts/eval_budgets_contracts.zip' target='_blank'>", "<img src='/logos/zip-ico.png' alt='Example Reports' width='35'>", "</a>")
}

textitems <- tibble(
  
   zip <- c(zip_link(),
            "Example Budget and Contract"
            )
   )
```

<center>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
kable(textitems, 
      col.names = c(""),
      escape = FALSE,
      align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "100em") %>%
  row_spec(1:2, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;', color = "#ffffff", background = "transparent") 
```
</center>
