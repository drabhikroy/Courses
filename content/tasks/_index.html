<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>engage with the readings and materials,</li>
<li>use R to complete any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> or analysis,</li>
<li>ask for help immediately after giving <strong>it</strong> (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and</li>

</ol>
<p>Below is a list of items considered to be class related tasks.</p>

<div id="r-tasks" class="section level2">
<h2>R Tasks</h2>
<p>On most weeks, you will be asked to submit an R related task. These must be turned in on the course <a href="https://2021edp613.slack.com">Slack</a> channel.</p>
</div>
<div id="meetings" class="section level2">
<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>Starting after the fourth week, we will need to meet on a biweekly basis to discuss project parameters and to give you an opportunity to ask questions, though this will vary depending on need. The sessions are scheduled for 15 minutes but can typically be adjusted if needed.</p>

<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>The final will consist of a project <a href="/tasks/proposal-tasks/">proposal</a> and <a href="/tasks/project-tasks/">paper</a> due several weeks apart. More information can be found by click on the appropriate deliverable.</p>

<div id="need-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since thatâ€™s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="https://2021edp693g.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>
