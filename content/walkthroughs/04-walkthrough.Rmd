This week you have two walkthroughs^[lucky you!] 

1. included in the [R Task](/modules/04-module/#r-task) download

## Adding Vertical Space to Multiple Choice Items

```{r echo = FALSE, purl=FALSE,}

dplyr::tibble(
  
  information <- c(
    "<b>Level of Difficulty</b><sup>1</sup>",
    "<b>What You'll Mainly Do</b>",
    "<b>Language(s) We'll Use</b><sup>2</sup>",
    ""
  ),
  
  description <- c(
    "<span style='color:#c5d9ff'>Beginner</span>",
    "Copy and paste syntax from a text (<code>.txt</code>) file to a Qualtrics and edit some numbers to customize parameters",
    "<div id='info'><div id='speechbubble' data-hover='Javascript'><span style='color:#f0db4f;'><span style='font-size: 40px;'><i class='icon-css3'></i></span></span></div></div>",
    ""

  add_footnote(
    c(
      "<span style='color:#f7f7f7; font-size:11pt;'><i>This is not an indicator of your personal level or abilities. You may experience varying level of ease and/or difficulties and that is OK!</i></span>", 
      "<span style='color:#f7f7f7; font-size:11pt;'><i>Hover over an icon to see its name</i></span>"),

```

### Prerequisite
Please go through this walkthrough *after* reviewing the [Survey Design](/tasks/04-task/#learn-about-crafting-high-quality-items) slideshow,

### Synopsis
Qualtrics houses quite a few built-in survey question types. While this is great, sometimes you need to amend these "stock" items. In this session, you'll look at one instance of this, in particular to understand how to add space of any size above (or below) a possible response within a multiple choice question that has a vertical layout.

### Materials
The following download includes a snippet, directions, and a copy of the gif shown below. The example survey was shared with you earlier in the term on Qualtrics^[To follow the directiions, you will need edit the survey. This can be done by accessing your [shared surveys](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/my-projects/sharing-a-project/#AccessingSharedSurveys) to [copy](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/my-projects/my-projects-overview/#Organizing) the instrument over to your account].
