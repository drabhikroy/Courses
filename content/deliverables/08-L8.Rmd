Carefully read through the directions below 

1. *Elevator Speech*. Create a 1 minute (+/- 10 seconds) [elevator talk](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/deconstructing-the-elevator-speech/){target="_blank"} introducing yourself, describing the evaluation, research, or project that your instrument was used for, mode/modes of data collection and analysis/analyses, summary of findings, and its significance^[with the intent to garner interest in your study]. **Akin to an online presentation, this must be a video of you talking, though additional materials that may help the audience to understand the study content and context is welcome**. Where elevator pitches are used for *pitching an idea*, elevator speeches are conducted to *sell the value of that idea*. For more information, head over to the [Creating an Elevator Talk](/resources/elevatortalk/) on the Resources page. If you use a third-party service (e.g. YouTube), provide a *publicly accessible* link.

2. Please submit the *Elevator Speech* to
  + [#elevator-speech]("https://edp618fall2022.slack.com/archives/C04CV0ANEB1"){target="_blank"} in a single posting on Slack
  
  + [eCampus]("https://ecampus.wvu.edu")
