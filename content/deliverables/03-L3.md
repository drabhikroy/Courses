This task involves a multi-step process to address the underlying research or evaluation question of your eventual survey. Please follow the directions below[^1]

1.  Review the feedback provided in your second deliverable

2.  Review the variable names and descriptions provided in the codebook again

3.  Amend the existing columns from the feedback and fill out the remaining columns that are applicable. These must directly reflect the survey shared on [Qualtrics](https://wvu.qualtrics.com)

4.  Again consider [auto-numbering](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/auto-number-questions/) your questions to renumber them in order. Then make sure to update the **Index** column with the item number provided in Qualtrics

5.  Rename the document by following the [submission guidelines](/tasks/#submission-formatting), save it in `xlsx` format, and submit this document to <a target="_blank" href="https://ecampus.wvu.edu/">eCampus</a><br><br>
