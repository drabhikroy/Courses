[^writing]: Keep in mind that evaluation is 10% reporting and 90% politics! You may find yourself walking a fine line in reporting findings while attempting to utilize a welcoming tone and readable narrative in your writeup. If you would like hints or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

[^consistency]:For example, all tables should follow the same structure and aesthetic, color palettes should remain the same for the same variable throughout, etc.
