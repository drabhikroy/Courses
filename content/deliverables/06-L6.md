1.  Open a copy of your previous task with feedback provided from me <img src="/logos/word-ico.png" alt="Word icon" width="50">

2.  Ensure that your name in the top left corner

3.  After reviewing any additional feedback, clear all comments and finalize your draft

4.  Create a one page [infographic](https://guides.library.unlv.edu/infographics/design) outlining your study. Some options include of course R (e.g. [Infographics Using R](https://rpubs.com/chidungkt/702513)), Adobe Photoshop (e.g. [Marketing Collateral: How to master an Infographic](https://www.adobe.com/vn_en/creativecloud/design/discover/make-infographic-in-photoshop.html)), [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/infographic), [Canva](https://www.canva.com/education/), [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com), and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) but feel free to use any software you like (yes even Microsoft Word). Then attach the final output within an appendix in your draft. To get an idea of how your visualization will be assessed, please take a look at [General Criteria for Visualizations](/resources/look/) located under Resources
