### <span style="color:#35d6ed">Submission</span>

<i>[eCampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu)</i>

### <span style="color:#65ddef">Type</span>

<i>Individual Submission</i>. Each student in the course must write their own narrative and should treat this as an individual submission. All remaining submissions will be team based unless otherwise noted.

### <span style="color:#7ae5f5">Description</span>

This task assumes that very little, if any groundwork has been completed in identifying a suitable program to evaluate. At this point, you should treat this as a thought experiment, in that *if you were given a choice, what program would you wish to evaluate?* no matter the size and/or scope.

### <span style="color:#97ebf4">Criteria</span>

Discuss your individual interests and given a choice on possible programs, list *at least* two choices. For each, provide a brief description of the following. Please note this is not a list, rather criteria that you should address within a narrative.

1.  A name and brief description of each program.
2.  The reason you believe an evaluation needs to occur.
3.  What type of primary and/or secondary evaluation you would implement and why.

### <span style="color:#c9f6ff">Structure</span>

Please include the following

1.  Your name in the top left hand corner
2.  Filename using the following format <kbd>yourlastname_prospectus.docx</kbd>
