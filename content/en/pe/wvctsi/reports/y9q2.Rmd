### Executive Summary and Key Recommendations

This is the quarterly tracking and evaluation report of the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) for the 2nd quarter (Q2) of fiscal year 2020/2021 (Y9), which covers a reporting period from October 1st, 2020 through December 31st, 2020. The WVCTSI received Y9 renewal notice of award dated July 9, 2020 with an annual award of 4,000,000 USD for the budget period from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and a total project period from August 15, 2012 through June 30, 2022.

This report prepared by WVCTSI Tracking and Evaluation Core personnel is organized by specific aim within each key component area/core plus information from partner institutions as available. This report does not describe every tracking and evaluation metric in each core, rather key elements and recommendations are summarized and readers are referred to the Quarterly Data Sheet (Excel) distributed with this report for information on all metrics as reported by all cores and partners.

During quarter 2 of year 9 there were 24 peer-reviewed publications officially linked to WVCTSI funding, 69 external funding proposals totaling over 28M USD, and 45 funded awards (6.6M USD).

#### Overall recommendations from Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Prepare for conclusion of this 5-year funding period including analysis of all specific aims to ensure appropriate activities will be completed and preparation of a competitive application for renewal.
-   While good progress has been made, continue efforts to ensure all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications have an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile and that those ORCID IDs are utilized for efficient identification and linking of all WVCTSI related publications and funding awards.
-   Ensure transparent and consistent utilization of iLab across cores and partners including core and partner assessment of alignment with action items agreed upon at May 29, 2019 WVCTSI Steering Committee meeting.
-   Continue to increase partner engagement, particularly with CAMC, NIOSH, and the VA.
-   Develop evidence of alignment between resource/effort allocations and priority health areas.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Begin shifting focus toward closing out this 5-year funding period, such as supporting efficient wrapping up of pilot award funding opportunities and preparing to submit a competitive renewal application.
-   Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to WVCTSI NIH funding award, including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-   Implement and support participation in a system where all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications have an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-   Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology & Biostatistics Core

-   Use Year 8 metric data in all metrics spreadsheet (Excel) distributed with this report to identify Year 9 annual targets for all appropriate metrics.
-   Identify barriers and work to increase service utilization across partner sites.
-   Implement and report activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources & Facilities Core

-   Consider ways to support researchers in activating TriNetX studies.
-   Identify appropriate metrics for Specific Aim 2 and report data on those metrics in upcoming quarterly report cycles.

#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement & Outreach Core

-   Consider capacity and opportunities to mentor additional investigators.
-   Continue and expand efforts to disseminate research results through publication in high-quality journals and other outlets.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

-   Specific Aim 1 includes mentored support to bring projects to completion. Consider how this mentored support and project completion should be distinguished from that done in the Professional Development core, as well as how it should be tracked and evaluated.
-   Prepare appropriate schedule of pilot award opportunities tapering down in preparation for end of budget period June 30, 2022, as well as how best to support funded pilots completing their scope of work by that date.

#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

-   Identify barriers and work to increase engagement with partner institutions outside of WVU Morgantown.
-   Continue working to roll out and evaluate new editorial services supportive of publication and grant proposal preparation.

#### Key Recommendations to Technology and Resources for Core Laboratories Core

-   Consider whether additional efforts should be directed toward genomics studies in the context of 1 total such study reported year-to-date with an annual target of 5.
-   Continue to consider opportunities to facilitate additional patentable projects.
-   Continue to facilitate excellent collaborative relationships between CAMC, Marshall, and WVU.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Support continued refinement of the publication reporting process, including identification of publications that should be linked to the grant and supporting roll-out of [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} utilization.
-   Continue to refine the progress report and related data portal used by the PD and Admin cores to collect quarterly report information.
-   Support continued refinement and more integrative inclusion of partner evaluation data within appropriate core reports.
-   Implement next steps for WVPBRN and ECHO evaluations.

#### Key Recommendations to Marshall University, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine

-   Work to implement and/or increase utilization of iLab.
-   Continue efforts to increase WVCTSI membership.
-   Work toward increasing awareness and utilization of WVCTSI core services.

## Cores

### Administrative Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Administrative.png){width=30%}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Implement an effective operational structure that facilitates attainment of all proposed WVCTSI Specific Aims and projects.*

There were 69 external funding proposals (28.2M USD) and 45 funded awards (6.6M USD) during Y9 Q2. Figure 1 show types of external funding proposed and awarded per cores contributing. WVCTSI Staff numbers are up by three this quarter, to 47. There were 8 disclosures, 4 active patents, and 1 provisional patent filed. It was notable that most of the patent-related activity at WVU was driven by WVCTSI members.

Tracking and Evaluation Core pulled linked publications from NCBI utilizing all appropriate grant numbers to accurately identify which publications should be considered linked to the grant in this and all previous quarters (see Table 1). Table 1 displays officially linked publications associated with each quarterly reporting period. Numbers in parentheses are additional publications with a current status of "ahead of print" that are expected to be linked to the grant at some point.

```{r drop1, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

        paste(
            '<p>',
'<button class="btn btn-primary collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ce1">',
'</button>',
'</p>',
'<div class="collapse" id="ce1">',
'<div class="card card-body">',  sep = "\n")
    } else {
        paste("</div>", "</div>", sep = "\n")
    }
})
```

*The data table will differ from the narrative within this report. The linked publications discussed in this document are based on the numbers from this table at the time this report was written and those have changed over time.*

It should be noted that linking publications requires substantial effort and lags in real time. While the total number of linked publications is not 50% of annual target at this time, it is on-track based on trends observed in past years where the number of publications continues to rise after a reporting period has ended.

There were 24 publications linked to the grant in Quarter 2. Cores and partners contributed to the following number of linked publications each: 7 ADMIN, 10 CRDEB, 5 PD, 4 TECH, 1 CRRF, 1 CEO, and 1 Pilot. These numbers do not sum to 24 because 5 publications included multiple contributing cores/partners and one newly linked publication was not attributed to a core. (See Figure 2).

In order to address the concern that WVCTSI may be supporting publications that are not being appropriately identified and linked to the grant, TEC pulls publications from appropriate library databases (e.g., PubMed) utilizing ORCID iDs when available and full names on the WVCTSI member list when ORCID iDs are not available and limiting the search to publications during the Y9 Q2 funding period. The list from the name-based search is reduced by including only those publications with author institutional affiliations in West Virginia. Core leadership review the list and contact all first authors regarding whether their publication should be linked to the grant. TEC also developed and implemented a new version of a quarterly progress report through which publications information is requested from all individuals who receive WVCTSI services or support.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create policies and procedures to drive performance, transparency, constructive communication and collaboration among multiple, diverse stakeholders (i.e., investigators, rural providers, community members).*

Q2 reported having 122,804 website visitor hits (down from 124k last quarter), with an average of 382 website visitors per day. WVCTSI's social media engagement has seen decrees for both Facebook and Listserv: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WVCTSI/){target="blank"} (from Q1 at +18 Likes and +17 follows to Q2 at +14 Likes and +14 follows), and [Listserv](https://www.wvctsi.org/membership/){target="blank"} (178 to 176). However, Twitter and YouTube both show increases: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} shows 39 new followers (up from 22 in Q1) with a total of 663 followers (up from 624 in Q1), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} Subscribers have increased from 655 (Y9Q1) to 806 (Y9Q2) follower with a total of +101k views.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Provide sound fiscal and resource management, ensuring appropriate resourcing of cores, flexibility to meet changing needs and environments, and sustainability of services.*

As noted above, WVCTSI supported 69 external funding proposals and 45 external awards this quarter. Percentage of NIH award expended ranged from 7 - 25%, with Admin spending the least (17%), and CRDEB and TEC spending the most (44 and 48%). There were 5 cost transfers/corrections reported this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 4

*Recruit talented, committed investigators addressing research questions relevant to the WVCTSI priority health areas.*

No Clinical Translational investigators were reported to be hired this quarter.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Begin shifting focus toward closing out this 5-year funding period, such as supporting efficient wrapping up of pilot award funding opportunities and preparing to submit a competitive renewal application.
-   Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to [WVCTSI NIH funding award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/Reporter_Viewsh.cfm?sl=14E8CB094A85C0D17598B8961CAA4A01A2FFCEB861BF){target="blank"}, including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-   Implement and support participation in a system where all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications have an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-   Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.

![](/reports/01-report_files/CRDEB.png){width=30%}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Effectively engage investigators throughout WV by providing traditional services in biostatistics and epidemiology.*

Investigators engage through the CRDEB core utilizing available resources including the Integrated Data Repository (IDR), REDCap, and TriNetX. There were 83 new REDCap users in Q2 with a total of 2,225 REDCap users to date (638 of which are active users). Of the 2,225 REDCap users, 1,712 were from WVU (536 active), 17 from CAMC (4 active), 13 from WVSOM (5 active), and 487 not affiliated with the above entities (97 active).

There were 159 new REDCap projects/data instruments (with a total of 2,733 projects/data instruments), 100 new REDCap service inquiries, and 9.75 hours of REDCap consultations were reported in Q2. The total number of current TriNetX users was 411 in Q2 and there were 2,579 new TriNetX inquiries, with 17 new TriNetX logins but there were 3 data set requests. CRDEB reported no practice/policy changes in Q2, nor were there any professional development events reported for Q2.

##### *Figure 4. CRRF iLab Core Management System services logged by month and service type. Download a copy of the [CRRF visualiation](/graphics/Y9Q2/crrf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

Note that Figure 4 visualizes services precisely as logged in iLab at the time of evaluation data collection. CRRF continues to fine-tune their utilization of iLab to conform with WVCTSI SOPs and numbers reported in the narrative here are based on core personnel data reports rather than iLab only data.

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create a Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (CTCOE) with connection to rural communities and practitioners, thereby providing access to cutting-edge trials addressing health disparities affecting West Virginians.*

CTCOE provided 116 unique instances of support to non-WVCTSI studies in the form of regulatory assistance (44), study coordination (31), accounting (41), or quality assurance audits (0) in Q2. Within the recently expanded activities by CTCOE (Q2Y8) which included Registration, a Risk Assessment Committee, and an Appeals Committee; there were 23 trials were registered, and 15 trials were reviewed, 12 of which were approved by the risk assessment committee. Additionally, CRRF supported 3 new Early Stage PIs with industry or WVCTSI-initiated funding in Q2. A total of 19 participants were recruited, with 24 more completing a study. CRRF had 14 TriNetX study offers and 8 accepted offers, and 1 study was activated this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Establish the Environmental Exposures Unit to stimulate environmental health research in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).*

While there has been some activity with NIOSH personnel, there have been no data reported on the Environmental Exposures Unit since the beginning of this funding cycle (2016).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources & Facilities Core

-   Use Year 8 metric data in all metrics spreadsheet (Excel) distributed with this report to identify Year 9 annual targets for all appropriate metrics.
-   Continue to work to align core personnel practices with WVCTSI SOPs for iLab data entry.
-   Identify appropriate metrics for Specific Aim 2 and report data on those metrics in upcoming quarterly report cycles.

### Community Engagement & Outreach Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Community_Engagement.png){width=30%}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Actively engage patients and other community stakeholders as research partners.*

There were 108 WVPBRN and 150 ECHO sites reported in Q2. This included the following 33 new ECHO sites: AccessHealth, MOV Health, United Summit Center, Piney Valley, Berkeley Springs Center, Meadowbrook Acres Nursing Center, Elkins Rehabilitation and Care Center, Positive Health Clinic Morgantown, Weirton Medical Center, Nella's Nursing Home, Inc., Meadowview Manor, Medical Laboratory Science, Speranza Therapeutics, WVU Occupational Medicine, WV Medical Professionals Health Program, WVU Medicine - Center for Quality Outcomes, WVU - Shared Research Facilities, WVU School of Public Health, WVU Cancer Institute, John J Gerlach Center Senior Health, Saint Joseph Hospital, WVU Medicine, WV Bureau of Public Health, Family Crisis Intervention Center of Region V Inc, Maxim Health Care, Raleigh General Hospital, WVU Health Sciences Center, Aetna, TriState Community Health Center Inc, Blue Marble Rehab Inc, WV Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), Monongahela Valley Hospital, and MedMark Treatment Center.

No new partner organizations were reported in Q2, however the annual target of 5 was met.

During Q2, there were 3 new CEO (non-ECHO) projects: WV Community Perceptions of COVID19 and Mitigation Factors, ATRN: COVID19: The Path Forward in Appalachia, and FORE Grant: Enhancing and Expanding MAT in Southern Appalachian Communities. Additionally, Q2 reported 3 networking opportunities: COVID-19 Echo (used for polling and a remote environment collaboration), Design Studio (used for PBRN members to network and collaborate online), and Pilot/ECHO Collaboration (inviting PIs from previous pilots to come disseminate results/research at ECHO sessions). Additionally, there was 1 Community Advisory Board meeting on 5/8: Project Updates: Special COVID19 Project: Wearable Monitoring Devices: Impacts of the Crisis on Communities Statewide, and 3 mentored investigator reported in Q2.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Transform community-identified research questions into externally-funded projects that improve health outcomes in WVCTSI health priority areas.*

There were 6 new, 44 ongoing, 3 completed WVPBRN projects, and of the 6 projects that were reviewed 6 were accepted in Q2. There were 223 Project Development and Success services, 125 Project Implementation services, 8 Community Engagement and Training services, 15 new Ideas on Deck services (9 WVSOM), 144 hours of ECHO services, 31 Consultation services, 23 hours of services for WVPBRN Activities, 1 funding opportunities were identified, 4 ongoing CEO projects, 1 new ECHO Project, and 25 services for products reported during Q2. CEO also contributed to 10 external funding proposals (totaling over 11.3M USD), 9 of which were in collaboration with other cores (Admin, PD, CRDEB, CRRF, and Pilot), and 8 externally funded projects (totaling over \$3M) in Q2. CEO contributed to 1 linked publication and no presentations were reported in Q2.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Translate and disseminate research results to inform West Virginia health policy and practice.*

In Q2 there were 107 Research Translation and Dissemination services provided. 1 CEO Project Policy Brief and 1 internal policy change.

##### *Figures 5 and 6. CEO core services logged by service type. Download a copy of the [CEO Category](/graphics/Y9Q2/ceo_plot_cat.pdf){target="blank"} and [CEO Charge](/graphics/Y9Q2/ceo_plot_charge.pdf){target="blank"} visualizations as high quality PDFs.*

Note that Figure 5 visualizes services precisely as logged in iLab at the time of evaluation data collection. CEO continues to fine-tune their utilization of iLab to conform with WVCTSI SOPs and numbers reported in the narrative here are based on core personnel data reports rather than iLab only data.

#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement & Outreach Core

-   Use Year 8 metric data in all metrics spreadsheet (Excel) distributed with this report to identify Year 9 annual targets for all appropriate metrics.
-   Continue to work to align core personnel practices with WVCTSI SOPs for iLab data entry. - Continue and expand efforts to disseminate research results through publication in high-quality journals and other outlets.

### Pilot Projects Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Pilot.png){width=30%}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Provide infrastructure supporting competitive pilot funding opportunities for early stage (ESI) and new investigators (NI) with subsequent mentored progression to project completion, publication, and external funding application.*

Three new pilot grant funding categories were used this quarter: Biostart, Pop-Up COVID 19, and A1Competition. In total, Pilot received 36 applications, including 22 from ESIs. Pilot granted 16 awards, to 12 ESI recipients. The Pilot core provided at least one workshop and 8 consultations. The Pilot core contributed to 2 publications and 1 presentation this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 2

There were 39 active Pilot projects addressing critical health issues in Q2. Additionally, the Pilot Core contributed to over 19M USD in external grant proposals and over 1.1M USD in external grants awarded.

#### Specific Aim 3.

*Implement the Launch Pad Pilot Program to maximize opportunities for commercialization of novel science.*

There was no launch award activity (letter of intent, applications, or awards) reported during quarter 4 however 5 active launch projects were reported this quarter.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

-   Use Year 8 metric data in all metrics spreadsheet (Excel) distributed with this report to identify Year 9 annual targets for all appropriate metrics.
-   Identify barriers and work to increase submissions of pilot project applications from partner institutions outside of WVU.
-   Specific Aim 1 includes mentored support to bring projects to completion. Consider how this mentored support and project completion should be distinguished from that done in the Professional Development core, as well as how it should be tracked and evaluated.

### Professional Development Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Professional_Development.png){width=30%}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create the Scientific and Career Success (SACS) program to provide access to formal mentoring for C/T researchers of all career stages.*

A total of 195 users requested 815 services through iLab in Q2, totaling 1148 iLab users. There were 26 new investigator development service requests through iLab. There were 2 reported orientations or consultations provided to investigators new to WVCTSI. Additionally, there were 12 external active members in the SACS program in Q2, as well as 5 female clinician scientists being mentored. There was 1 special event/program for women in science in Q2 titled FACTS: Balancing Act: Walking the Tightrope Amidst COVID-19.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Develop formal programs that serve as "on-ramps" to introduce C/T research to early or new investigators and trainees at different career stages.*

The PD core reported 3 undergraduate students, and no full team meeting, as well as 4 professional development activities: (1) PI Academy Idea Lab June 3- Presenter: Ankit Sakhuja, (2) PI Academy Idea Lab April 1- Presenter: Kyle Ritchie, (3) PI Academy Idea Lab May 6 - Presenter: James Bardes, and (4) Webinar- Clinicaltrials.gov- Presenter: Dr. Ford, Johns Hopkins.

There was 2 CTS Certificate enrolled and CTS MS had 1 new student enrolled (with 5 applications received and 3 offers made) at WVU in Q2 (MU enrollment was not reported). CTS PhD program had one degree conferred during Quarter 4. Education programming reported did not have any new academic courses, workshops, or C/T research seminars. There were 39 unique participants in educational programming, 31 originating from WVU, 2 from MU, 0 from CAMC, and 6 from SOM.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Develop educational opportunities to support and retain externally funded C/T researchers statewide.*

The Professional Development core contributed to 14 external funding proposals (over 6.6M USD); 5 of which were collaborative with singular cores: ADMIN (1), CEO (2), Pilots (3), and TECH (1) and 7 externally funded awards totaling more than 1.7M USD. The Professional Development core reported 4 presentations supported by CTR Award and 3 linked publications.

Figure 9 displays Investigator Development Services as logged in iLab by month and service type. Demand for Pre-Award services appears to vary dramatically month-to-month, but it is unclear whether this might be an artifact of iLab data entry not conforming to WVCTSI SOPs.

#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

-   Use Year 8 metric data in all metrics spreadsheet (Excel) distributed with this report to identify Year 9 annual targets for all appropriate metrics.
-   Consider whether demand by service type varies month-to-month and shift either iLab data entry protocols if it does not or consider whether resources need shifting to most efficiently meet demand across time if it does.
-   Identify barriers and work to increase engagement with partner institutions outside of WVU Morgantown.

#### Specific Aim 1

*Develop Investigator Tracking and Support System (ITSS) utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors contributing to success or providing barriers to productivity.*

TEC continued communicating with key contacts to refine metrics for increased reporting accuracy, with CRRF having the most significant updates. TEC identified all publications linked to WVCTSI grant numbers directly from NCBI. TEC provided an updated list of publications that potentially should be linked, which list is currently being reviewed by other cores. TEC continues to refine Social Network Analysis visualizations to show collaboration among authors on linked publications as well as geographic location. TEC continues to analyze Awareness Survey data with a full report of findings to be completed next quarter.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create and implement systematic set of tools and measurements to drive continuous quality improvement and demonstrate impact of community stakeholder participation and engagement.*

TEC continued to work with CEO and ECHO on the ECHO "SuperHub" evaluation plan. During this quarter two interviews were completed. Potential publications for the ECHO project are currently being conceptualized. TEC completed and shared the Alumni survey report with the PD Core, which was the first survey to be shared in an electronic format with interactive data visualizations. TEC completed and disseminated the first version of the progress report for the PD Core to collect quarterly reporting data. TEC will continue to work with the PD Core to make improvements and increase efficiency in analyzing the data. TEC began building a password protected website to house all WVCTSI TEC reports over time. TEC continued to work with CEO related to WVPBRN network evaluation.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Build focused research and evaluation demonstrating WVCTSI impacts on health outcomes in West Virginia.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Report for the 3rd Quarter of Y8 was disseminated in Q2 of Y8. Additionally, a TEC core member contributed to an NIH supplement designed with the following two specific aims:

1.  describe community attitudes toward opioid use disorder and harm reduction services including syringe exchange, and
2.  understand the multilevel syndemic factors that may contribute to development of opioid use disorder among young women for the purposes of informing future intervention studies. TEC's qualitative specialist continued to refine and analyze interview data. The ECHO research evaluation plan when completed will demonstrate impact on health outcomes.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Support continued refinement of the publication reporting process, including identification of publications that should be linked to the grant and supporting roll-out of [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} utilization.
-   Support continued refinement and more integrative inclusion of partner evaluation data within appropriate core reports.
