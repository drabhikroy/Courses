### Executive Summary and Key Recommendations

This is the quarterly tracking and evaluation report of the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) for the 1st quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2021/2022 (Y10), which covers a reporting period from July 1st, 2021 through September 30th, 2021. The WVCTSI received Y10 renewal notice of award dated June 30, 2021 with an annual award of 4,000,000 USD for the budget period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and a total project period from August 15, 2012 through June 30, 2022. 

This report prepared by WVCTSI Tracking and Evaluation Core personnel is organized by specific aim within each key component area/core plus information from partner institutions as available. This report does not describe every tracking and evaluation metric in each core, rather key elements and recommendations are summarized and readers are referred to the Quarterly Data Sheet (Excel) distributed with this report for information on all metrics as reported by all cores and partners. 

At the close of the reporting period, there were 31 peer-reviewed publications officially linked  to WVCTSI funding, 12 presentations, 40 external funding proposals totaling over 27.6 million USD, and 55 funded awards (16.2 million USD) for quarter 1 of year 10. 

#### Overall recommendations from Tracking and Evaluation Core

- Review Year 9 targets and totals (see [Year 9 Quarter 4 Evaluation Report](/reports/y9q4/)) as context for setting Year 10 annual targets for all dashboard and appropriate core-specific metrics.
- While good progress has been made and 512 investigators have registered ORCID ID’s, continue efforts to ensure all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile and that those ORCID ID’s are utilized for efficient identification and linking of all WVCTSI related publications and funding awards.
- Every core and partner should review action items agreed upon at May 29, 2019 WVCTSI Steering Committee meeting and make any changes necessary to ensure transparent and consistent utilization of iLab across cores and partners.
- Develop evidence of alignment between resource/effort allocations and priority health areas.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-	Set annual targets for year 10.
-	Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to [WVCTSI NIH funding award](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10213751), including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-	Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.


#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Identify barriers and work to increase service utilization across partner sites. Consider whether professional development events targeted at increasing service utilization should be planned.


#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.


#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement and Outreach Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
-	Focus on completing WVPBRN and CEO projects as this funding cycle comes to a close.
-	Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.
-	Consider how to increase utilization of Community Engagement and Training services.


#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Consider planning and delivering workshops, mentoring, or other types of support targeted at supporting funded pilot awardees completing their scope of work by June 30, 2022.


#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

### Administrative Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Administrative.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Implement an effective operational structure that facilitates attainment of all proposed WVCTSI Specific Aims and projects.*

WVCTSI had 40 external funding proposals (27.6 million USD) and 55 funded awards (16.2 million USD) during Y10 Q1. Of these Admin was directly linked to 14 external funding proposals (10.2 million USD) and 17 external awards (12.6 million USD) this quarter. Figures 1 and 2 show types of external funding proposed and awarded per cores contributing. WVCTSI Staff numbers in Q1 are 71 (no change from last quarter).

##### *Figure 3. Contributions per core to Y10Q1 WVCTSI linked publications. Download a copy of the [publication](/graphics/Y10Q1/pubs.pdf){target="blank"} visualization as a high quality PDF.*

Table 1 displays officially linked publications associated with each quarterly reporting period. While the current number of linked publications is higher, there were 31 publications linked to the grant at the close of Quarter 1. Cores and partners contributed to the following number of those linked publications each: 11 ADMIN, 3 CEO, 9 CRDEB, 4 Pilot, 11 PD, and 7 TECH . These counts do not add up to 31 due to multiple cores being linked with several publications. Core contributions to linked publications are displayed in Figure 3.

Linking publications requires substantial effort and lags real time. While the total number of linked publications has not reached the annual target at this time, it is on-track based on trends observed in past years where the number of publications continues to rise after a reporting period has ended. Accordingly, the number of linked publications at the time the reporting period closed and for which core contributions are reported here will be fewer than those reported in the table above because additional publications continue to be linked daily.

*Note: Numbers of linked publications do not include those that were embargoed at the time these data were pulled. Publications are categorized as "published" and "in-press".*

In order to address the concern that WVCTSI may be supporting publications that are not being appropriately identified and linked to the grant, TEC pulls publications from appropriate public databases (e.g., PubMed) utilizing ORCID ID’s when available and full names on the WVCTSI member list when ORCID ID’s are not available then limiting the search to publications during the current funding period. The list from the name-based search is reduced by including only those publications with author institutional affiliations in West Virginia. Core leadership review the list and contact all first authors regarding whether their publication should be linked to the grant. TEC continues to use the quarterly progress report through which publications, among several other types of information, are requested from all individuals who receive WVCTSI services or support.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create policies and procedures to drive performance, transparency, constructive communication and collaboration among multiple, diverse stakeholders (i.e., investigators, rural providers, community members).*

Administration Core reported having 121,211 website visitor hits (up from 102K last quarter), with an average of 407.3 website visitors per day during Q4. WVCTSI's social media engagement reported in Q4 includes:

Administration Core reported having 149,235 [website](https://www.wvctsi.org/){target="blank"} visitor hits (up from 121k last quarter), with an average of 414 website visitors per day during Q1.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Provide sound fiscal and resource management, ensuring appropriate resourcing of cores, flexibility to meet changing needs and environments, and sustainability of services.*

As noted above, WVCTSI supported 40 external funding proposals and 55 external awards this quarter. Percentage of NIH award expended ranged between 7% and 26% in Q1 with Admin being the lowest and TEC being the highest. There were 4 cost transfers/corrections reported this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 4

*Recruit talented, committed investigators addressing research questions relevant to the WVCTSI priority health areas.*

No Clinical Translational investigators were reported as hired this quarter.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to [WVCTSI NIH funding award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/Reporter_Viewsh.cfm?sl=14E8CB094A85C0D17598B8961CAA4A01A2FFCEB861BF){target="blank"}, including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"}  as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
- Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Implement cutting-edge tools and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology, with a particular focus on the needs of WV researchers.*

CRDEB reported 40 BMIR-related inquiries, 14 new CRDEB consultations, 1 sample size/power consultations, 14 new statistical analysis consultations, and no new clinical study design consultations in Q1. Additionally, 532.25 hours were dedicated to biostatistics consultations. Zero GIS analysis consultations were reported for Q1.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Disseminate current and classical information in biostatistics and epidemiology*

There were 9 linked publications supported by CRDEB, where 5 were standalone and 4 were supported in collaboration with other cores; TECH, Admin, Pilot, and PD. CRDEB contributed to 3 external funding proposals (totaling over 2.2M USD) in Q1. Of these external funding proposals, 1 was standalone proposals (33,500.00 USD), 2 were in collaboration with other cores (2.17M USD); which included 1 with PD and 1 with CRRF.  CRDEB supported 4 external funding awards (totaling over 3.7M USD) in Q1. Of these 4 external funding awards, 2 were stand alone, 1 was in collaboration with CRRF, and 1 was in collaboration with Admin. 

#### Specific Aim 4^[CRDEB Specific Aim 4 was previously CRRF Specific Aim 2.This revision was specified by letter to NIH dated November 27, 2017 and subsequently approved.]

*Leverage the newly enhanced Integrated Data Repository (IDR2) and partnership through the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC) to facilitate outcomes research, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis.*

There were 12 new custom IDR dataset requests, 0 requests for updates to previous IDR datasets, and 12 IDR projects reported as completed in Q1. There were 251.75 hours spent on new data requests, 0 hours on updates to previous data sets and data request consultation. CRDEB did not report any activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC). 

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Identify barriers and work to increase service utilization across partner sites. Consider whether professional development events targeted at increasing service utilization should be planned.

##### *Figure 6. CRRF OnCore studies by month Download as copy of the [CRRF visualization](/graphics/Y10Q1/crrf_studies_plot.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create a Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (CTCOE) with connection to rural communities and practitioners, thereby providing access to cutting-edge trials addressing health disparities affecting West Virginians.*

In Q1, CTCOE provided 140 unique instances of support to non-WVCTSI studies in the form of regulatory assistance (44), study coordination (34), accounting (61), and quality assurance audits (1). Within the expanded activities by CTCOE (established Q2Y8) which included Registration, a Risk Assessment Committee, and an Appeals Committee; there were 26 trials approved, 15 trials reviewed, and 15 approved by the risk assessment committee. CRRF did not support any new Early-Stage PI’s with industry. CTCOE supported 1 WVCTSI-initiated funding trials in new research areas. 290 participants were recruited, with 123 more completing a study. CRRF had 22 TriNetX study offers and 9 accepted at WVU, with 0 studies activated in Q1. CRRF reported 2 PI Academy events and 2 new PI Academy members.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Establish the Environmental Exposures Unit to stimulate environmental health research in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).*

While there has been some activity with NIOSH personnel, there have been no data reported on the Environmental Exposures Unit since the beginning of this funding cycle (2016).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

- Set annual targets for year 10.
- Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.

### Community Engagement and Outreach Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Community_Engagement.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Actively engage patients and other community stakeholders as research partners.*

There were 108 WVPBRN and 188 ECHO sites reported in Q1. This included new ECHO sites: (1) Mountain Care Network – WV, (2) Reginald D. Henery Attorney at Law PLLC – WV, (3) Healthy Minds - WV, (4) Scott Memorial Hospital – Indiana, (5) Welch Community Hospital, (6) Holston Medical - Virginia, (7) St. Texas Tech University Health Science Center – Texas, (8) St. David's Hospital – Texas, (9) Centerville Clinics - Pennsylvania, and (10) WVU Eastern Division – WV. There were 7 new partner organizations in Q1: (1) TN Department of Health (ECHO), (2) Centurion (ECHO), (3) Gilmer County Emergency Management, (4) Potomac State College, (5) Amma Nursing Home, (6) University of So. California, and (7) Rising Star (Marion Co).

During Q1, there was 0 new CEO (non-ECHO) projects and 1 ECHO project (Second cohort of the Judiciary ECHO around SUD - Partnership with the National Center for State Courts and WVCTSI Project ECHO SUD Hub team to educate and mentor WV judges in the uses of MAT). CEO reported 2 networking opportunities: Design Studio and PBRN Retreat. There were 1 Community Advisory Board meeting (August 17th CAB Meeting via Zoom). 

#### Specific Aim 2

*Transform community-identified research questions into externally-funded projects that improve health outcomes in WVCTSI health priority areas.*

There were 2 new, 33 ongoing, and 4 completed WVPBRN projects as well as 0 new, 2 ongoing, and 0 completed CEO projects. 2 WVPBRN projects were reviewed in Q1 and accepted. There were, 17 Community Engagement and Training services, 275 Project Implementation services, 126 Project Development and Success services, 1 new Ideas on Deck service, 15 Consultation services, 33 WVPBRN Activities, 1 funding opportunity identified, 143 hours of ECHO services, and 25 services for products reported during Q1. CEO reported contributing to 3 linked publications collaborations (1 each with Pilot, Admin, and PD). CEO had 3 supported external funding proposals (totaling over 238K USD) in Q1, all of which were stand alone. CEO supported 1 standalone external funding awards totaling 200.00 USD in Q1. 

#### Specific Aim 3

*Translate and disseminate research results to inform West Virginia health policy and practice.*

In Q1, there were 23 Research Translation and Dissemination services, 3 practice changes, (2 external, 1 internal), and 1 policy changes or policy project briefs reported.

### Tracking and Evaluation Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Tracking_and_Evaluation.png){width="30%"}

Tracking and Evaluation brought on 2 new team members to replace individuals who left the institution, an evaluation specialist and a graduate assistant. TEC members submitted an abstract for a special issue of the Journal of Multidisciplinary Evaluation (JME) focused on the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation (JCSEE) Program Evaluation Standards. The abstract was accepted, and TEC was invited to submit a full manuscript in Year 10 Quarter 3.

#### Specific Aim 1

*Develop Investigator Tracking and Support System (ITSS) utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors contributing to success or providing barriers to productivity.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Core (TEC) identified all publications linked to WVCTSI grant numbers directly from NCBI and created a [web-based table](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} displaying this information publicly, as well as [Social Network Analysis visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/networkacross/){target="blank"} to show collaboration among authors on linked publications.
TEC completed and disseminated the Awareness Survey report in Q1.

TEC continues to refine the quarterly progress report through which all individuals who receive support/ services from WVCTSI are requested to report information on activity and products generated. TEC updated a [user-friendly data portal](https://percwv.com/reports/portal2/){target="blank"} through which stakeholders can utilize progress report data. 

TEC utilizes an ORCID ID survey to gather WVCTSI member ORCID ID’s to be added to membership list, which currently includes ORCID ID for 512 members (13% of 3,797). This allows more accurate searches for publications by members that should be linked to the grant. TEC created a logic model for the Fellows Research Academy pilot project and is awaiting feedback on a post-participation survey.

TEC began work on conceptualizing a new membership database.  Once completed this database will house member information, services received, and outputs (i.e., publications, grant proposals, funded awards).  This database will be made available to all WVCTSI staff to allow verification of membership and a record of services/outputs.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create and implement systematic set of tools and measurements to drive continuous quality improvement and demonstrate impact of community stakeholder participation and engagement.*

TEC continued to work with CEO, WVPBRN, and ECHO on the ECHO “SuperHub” and WVPBRN evaluation plans. TEC developed a collaboration survey to be presented during a session at the WVPBRN retreat, however the event was moved to be virtual due to an increase in COVID cases. The survey was briefly discussed over zoom and sent by email, however the return was low and will need to be revisited.  

In collecting information through the quarterly progress report mentioned above, we were able to identify additional publications that should be linked to the WVCTSI grant numbers. TEC will continue to work with PD and Admin to make improvements and increase efficiency in analyzing such data. TEC continues to make updates to the [website](https://percwv.com/){target="blank"} that houses a) all tracking and evaluation [reports](https://percwv.com/login/){target="blank"} years 6 through current (password protected), b) an automated [linked publications hub](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} with counts, full references, and abstracts (publicly available), c) [social network visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/){target="blank"} of linked publication author networks (publicly available), and d) the [quarterly progress report data portal](https://percwv.com/reports/portal2/){target="blank"} (password protected).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Build focused research and evaluation demonstrating WVCTSI impacts on health outcomes in West Virginia.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Report for the 4th Quarter of Y9 was disseminated in Q1 and will be discussed at a WVCTSI Steering Committee meeting. The ECHO and WVPBRN research evaluation plans when completed will demonstrate impact on health outcomes. 

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

- Review all metrics alignment to specific aims and consider implications for quarterly reporting during the current funding cycle ending 6/30/2022. Conduct similar analysis related to specific aims in renewal application and prepare for evaluation changes beginning 7/1/2022.
- Support continued refinement of the publication reporting process, including identification of publications that should be linked to the grant and supporting roll-out of [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} utilization.
- Continue to refine the progress report and related data portal for use by PD, Pilot, and Admin cores to collect quarterly report information from individuals receiving WVCTSI services, protected time, or other support.
- Implement next steps for WVPBRN and ECHO evaluations. 
- Continue to refine and enhance data collection and visualization tools available online.
