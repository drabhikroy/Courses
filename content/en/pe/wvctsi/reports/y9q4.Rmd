### Executive Summary and Key Recommendations

This is the quarterly tracking and evaluation report of the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) for the 4th quarter (Q4) of fiscal year 2020/2021 (Y9), which covers a reporting period from April 1st, 2021 through June 30th, 2021.
The WVCTSI received Y9 renewal notice of award dated July 9, 2020 with an annual award of 4,000,000 USD for the budget period from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and a total project period from August 15, 2012 through June 30, 2022.

This report prepared by WVCTSI Tracking and Evaluation Core personnel is organized by specific aim within each key component area/core plus information from partner institutions as available. This report does not describe every tracking and evaluation metric in each core, rather key elements and recommendations are summarized and readers are referred to the Quarterly Data Sheet (Excel) distributed with this report for information on all metrics as reported by all cores and partners. At the close of the reporting period, there were 24 peer-reviewed publications officially linked to WVCTSI funding with 5 additional pending, 19 presentations, 74 external funding proposals totaling over 124 USD million, and 42 funded awards (10.7 million USD) for quarter 4 of year 9^[Publications are officially linked if they appear in NCBI as published (excluding *epub ahead of print*) and are associated with quarterly reporting periods based on their official NCBI publication date (not ahead of print date).We report all linked publications including any embargoed that do not yet appear on the public facing NCBI list. The number of linked publications for each quarter continues to rise following the end of the reporting period.]

Annual targets were exceeded for number of external funding proposals submitted and funded, disclosures submitted, patent applications, and membership (including non-Morgantown and community members). Annual targets have not been met for external funding amount awarded or number of linked publications, patents awarded, or investigators accessing WVCTSI services. The number of linked publications lags real time and will continue to rise, especially for quarters 3 and 4.

#### Overall recommendations from Tracking and Evaluation Core

-  Prepare for conclusion of this 5-year funding period including analysis of all specific aims to ensure appropriate activities are completed and prepare a competitive application for renewal.
-  While good progress has been made and 495 investigators have registered [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"}s, continue efforts to ensure all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications have an ORCID iD as part of their WVCTSI membership profile and that those ORCID iDs are utilized for efficient identification and linking of all WVCTSI related publications and funding awards.
-  Ensure transparent and consistent utilization of iLab across cores and partners including core and partner assessment of alignment with action items agreed upon at May 29, 2019 WVCTSI Steering Committee meeting.
-  Develop evidence of alignment between resource/effort allocations and priority health areas.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-  Shift focus toward closing out this 5-year funding period, such as supporting efficient wrapping up of pilot award funding opportunities and piloting/evaluating recent new endeavors in support of a competitive renewal application.
-  Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to WVCTSI NIH funding award, including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-  Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core

-   Identify barriers and work to increase service utilization across partner sites. Consider whether professional development events targeted at increasing service utilization should be planned.
-   Implement and report activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC). Consider how to position such activity in a competitive renewal application.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

-   Plan and deliver PI Academy events.
-   Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.
-   Identify appropriate metrics for Specific Aim 2 and consider how to position activity related to this aim in a competitive renewal application.

#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement and Outreach Core

-   Consider whether frequency of Community Advisory Board meetings is appropriate.
-   Focus on completing WVPBRN and CEO projects as this funding cycle comes to a close.
-   Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.
-   Consider how to increase utilization of Community Engagement and Training services.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

-   Consider planning and delivering workshops, mentoring, or other types of support targeted at supporting funded pilot awardees completing their scope of work by June 30, 2022.

#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

-   Consider the viability of the CTS Certificate program considering there are no students reported as enrolled, applying, or accepted.
-   Increase engagement and utilization of services by individuals at partner institutions outside of WVU Morgantown.
-   Continue working to roll out and evaluate new editorial services supportive of publication and grant proposal preparation. Consider how to position such activity in competitive renewal application.

#### Key Recommendations to Technology and Resources for Core Laboratories Core

-   Consider additional opportunities to facilitate patentable projects, collecting and utilizing biospecimen samples at WVU, and genomics studies at WVU.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Support continued refinement of the publication reporting process, including identification of publications that should be linked to the grant and supporting roll-out of [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} utilization.
-   Continue to refine the progress report and related data portal for use by PD, Pilot, and Admin cores to collect quarterly report information from individuals receiving WVCTSI services, protected time, or other support.
-   Implement next steps for WVPBRN and ECHO evaluations. Consider how to position that activity in a competitive renewal application.
-   â€¢ Continue to refine and enhance data collection and visualization tools available online at <https://percwv.com/> for use by all stakeholders.

#### Key Recommendations to Marshall University, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine

-   Work to implement and/or increase utilization of iLab.
-   Continue efforts to increase WVCTSI membership, and increase awareness and utilization of WVCTSI core services at each partner institution.

### Administrative Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Administrative.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Implement an effective operational structure that facilitates attainment of all proposed WVCTSI Specific Aims and projects.*

WVCTSI had 74 external funding proposals (124+ USD million) and 42 funded awards (10.7 USD million) during Y9 Q4. Of these Admin was directly linked to 24 external funding proposals (98.6 USD million) and 7 external awards (1.7 USD million) this quarter. Figures 1 and 2 show types of external funding proposed and awarded per cores contributing. WVCTSI Staff numbers in Q4 are 71 (up 3 from last quarter).

Tracking and Evaluation Core pulled linked publications from NCBI utilizing all appropriate grant numbers to accurately identify which publications should be considered linked to the grant in this and all previous quarters (see Table 1).

Table 1 displays officially linked publications associated with each quarterly reporting period. Numbers in parentheses are additional publications with a current status of *ahead of print* that are expected to be linked to the grant at some point.

```
 
*Note:*

- *Numbers of linked publications do not include those that were embargoed at the time these data were pulled. Publications are categorized as "published" and "in-press".*

- *Linking publications requires substantial effort and lags real time. While the total number of linked publications has not reached the annual target at this time, it is on-track based on trends observed in past years where the number of publications continues to rise after a reporting period has ended. Accordingly, the number of linked publications at the time the reporting period closed and for which core contributions are reported here will be fewer than those reported in the table above because additional publications continue to be linked daily.*

##### *Figure 3. Contributions per core to Y9Q4 WVCTSI linked publications. Download a copy of the [publication](/graphics/Y9Q4/pubs.pdf){target="blank"} visualization as a high quality PDF.*

In order to address the concern that WVCTSI may be supporting publications that are not being appropriately identified and linked to the grant, TEC pulls publications from appropriate library databases (e.g., PubMed) utilizing ORCID iDs when available and full names on the WVCTSI member list when ORCID iDs are not available and limiting the search to publications during the Y9Q4 funding period. The list from the name-based search is reduced by including only those publications with author institutional affiliations in West Virginia. Core leadership review the list and contact all first authors regarding whether their publication should be linked to the grant. TEC continues to use the quarterly progress report through which publications, among several other types of information, are requested from all individuals who receive WVCTSI services or support.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create policies and procedures to drive performance, transparency, constructive communication and collaboration among multiple, diverse stakeholders (i.e., investigators, rural providers, community members).*

Administration Core reported having 121,211 website visitor hits (up from 102K last quarter), with an average of 407.3 website visitors per day during Q4. WVCTSI's social media engagement reported in Q4 includes:

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WVCTSI/){target="blank"} Facebook New Likes and Followers are down (from the +37 Likes and +115 Followers in Q3, to +12 Likes and +15 Followers in Q4, new [Listserv](https://www.wvctsi.org/membership/){target="blank"} subscribers increased from 200 in Q3 to 218 in Q4 (bringing total to 3379), new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} Twitter followers decreased from 56 to 14 in Q4 (bringing total to 694 followers), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wvctsi/){target="blank"} is down from 39 new followers to 13 new followers (bringing the total to 120), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} subscribers have increased from 953 (Y9Q3) to 1,060 followers (Y9Q4) with a total of +132k views.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Provide sound fiscal and resource management, ensuring appropriate resourcing of cores, flexibility to meet changing needs and environments, and sustainability of services.*

As noted above, WVCTSI supported 74 external funding proposals and 42 external awards this quarter. Percentage of NIH award expended was at 100% in Q4. There were 25 cost transfers/corrections reported this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 4

*Recruit talented, committed investigators addressing research questions relevant to the WVCTSI priority health areas.*

No Clinical Translational investigators were reported as hired this quarter.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Shift focus toward closing out this 5-year funding period, such as supporting efficient wrapping up of pilot award funding opportunities and piloting/evaluating recent new endeavors in support of a competitive renewal application. Continue to facilitate core and partner discussions and collaborative efforts to innovatively facilitate additional publications supported by and linked to [WVCTSI NIH funding award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/Reporter_Viewsh.cfm?sl=14E8CB094A85C0D17598B8961CAA4A01A2FFCEB861BF){target="blank"}, including continued effort to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"} as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.
-   Identify barriers to partner participation and engagement; work to increase membership and service utilization across partner sites.

### Clinical Research Design Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/CRDEB.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Effectively engage investigators throughout WV by providing traditional services in biostatistics and epidemiology.*

Investigators engage through the CRDEB core utilizing available resources including the Integrated Data Repository (IDR), REDCap, and TriNetX. There were 140 new REDCap users in Q4 with a total of 2,493 REDCap users to date (775 of which are active users). Of the 2,793 REDCap users, 1,863 were from WVU (575 active), 19 from CAMC (5 active), 15 from WVSOM (6 active), and 596 not affiliated with the above entities (189 active). There were 8.5 hours reported in the category of updating existing REDCap projects and providing project follow-up meetings in Q4. 3 REDCap projects were made for WVCTSI-funded investigators and 2 REDCap projects were made for non-WVCTSI investigators. There was a total of 3,062 REDCap projects and 8,045 data instruments, 152 new REDCap service inquiries, and 12.5 hours of REDCap consultations reported in Q4. The total number of current TriNetX users was 456 in Q4 and there were 5,162 new TriNetX inquiries, with 26 new TriNetX logins and 3 data set requests. CRDEB reported 1 practice/policy changes in Q4 and no professional development events.

##### *Figure 4. CRDEB iLab Core Management System services logged by month and service type. Download a copy of the [CRDEB visualization](/graphics/Y9Q4/crdeb.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 2

CRDEB reported 34 BMIR-related inquiries, 15 new CRDEB consultations, 2 sample size/power consultations, 27 new statistical analysis consultations, and 8 new clinical study design consultations in Q4. Additionally, 694.25 hours were dedicated to biostatistics consultations. Zero GIS analysis consultations were reported for Q4.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Disseminate current and classical information in biostatistics and epidemiology*

CRDEB contributed to 11 external funding proposals (totaling over 6.3 USD M) in Q4. Of these external funding proposals, 5 were standalone proposals (2.5 USD M), 6 were in collaboration with other cores (3.8 USD M); which included 2 with Admin/CRRF, 1 with Admin/CEO/CRRF, 1 with PD, and 1 with CRRF. CRDEB supported 2 external funding awards (totaling over 12 USD K) in Q4. Of these 2 external funding awards, 1 was in collaboration with CRRF. There were 14 linked publications supported by CRDEB, where 3 of those publications were supported in collaboration with other cores; TECH, CRDEB, and PD.

#### Specific Aim 4^[CRDEB Specific Aim 4 was previously CRRF Specific Aim 2.This revision was specified by letter to NIH dated November 27, 2017 and subsequently approved.]

*Leverage the newly enhanced Integrated Data Repository (IDR2) and partnership through the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC) to facilitate outcomes research, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis.*

There were 6 new custom IDR dataset requests, 2 requests for updates to previous IDR datasets, and 17 IDR projects reported as completed in Q4. There were 329.5 hours spent on new data requests, 0 hours on updates to previous data sets, and 35.5 hours on data request consultation. CRDEB did not report any activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC).

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Identify barriers and work to increase service utilization across partner sites. Consider whether professional development events targeted at increasing service utilization should be planned.
-   Implement and report activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC). Consider how to position such activity in a competitive renewal application.

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create a Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (CTCOE) with connection to rural communities and practitioners, thereby providing access to cutting-edge trials addressing health disparities affecting West Virginians.*

In Q4, CTCOE provided 126 unique instances of support to non-WVCTSI studies in the form of regulatory assistance (40), study coordination (30), accounting (55), and quality assurance audits (1). Within the expanded activities by CTCOE (established Q2Y8) which included Registration, a Risk Assessment Committee, and an Appeals Committee; there were 20 trials registered, 14 trials reviewed, and 11 approved by the risk assessment committee. Additionally, CRRF supported 4 new Early Stage PI's with industry or WVCTSI-initiated funding and 3 trials in new research areas. 219 participants were recruited, with 48 more completing a study. CRRF had 27 TriNetX study offers and 12 accepted at WVU, and 1 study was activated in Q4. CRRF reported 0 PI Academy events and 4 new PI Academy members.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Establish the Environmental Exposures Unit to stimulate environmental health research in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).*

While there has been some activity with NIOSH personnel, there have been no data reported on the Environmental Exposures Unit since the beginning of this funding cycle (2016).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

-   Plan and deliver PI Academy events.
-   Consider innovative ways to support or contribute to linked publications.
-   Identify appropriate metrics for Specific Aim 2 and consider how to position activity related to this aim in a competitive renewal application.

### Pilot Projects Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Pilot.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Provide infrastructure supporting competitive pilot funding opportunities for early stage (ESI) and new investigators (NI) with subsequent mentored progression to project completion, publication, and external funding application.*

Pilot core received 14 small grant applications and awarded 6 small pilot projects. There will not be any new pilot funding opportunities this cycle to facilitate completion of all funded pilots. Pilot core provided 0 workshops, had 9 requested services, and contributed to 7 linked publications, 3 of which in collaboration: Admin (1), TECH (1), CRDEB/MU (1).

#### Specific Aim 2

There were 34 active Pilot projects in Q4 addressing critical health issues. Additionally, the Pilot Core contributed to 3 standalone external grant proposals (totaling over 726 USD K) and 1 standalone external funding award (50 USD K).

#### Specific Aim 3.

*Implement the Launch Pad Pilot Program to maximize opportunities for commercialization of novel science.*

No additional Launch Pad Pilot projects will start the remainder of this funding cycle.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

-   Consider planning and delivering workshops, mentoring, or other types of support targeted at funded pilot awardees completing their scope of work by June 30, 2022.

### Professional Development Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Professional_Development.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create the Scientific and Career Success (SACS) program to provide access to formal mentoring for C/T researchers of all career stages.*

There were 232 individuals who requested 511 services in Q4. There were 24 new investigator development service requests logged through iLab. There was 1 reported orientation or consultation provided to investigators new to WVCTSI. Additionally, there were 38 active mentors in the SACS program, as well as 3 female clinician scientists being mentored in Q4. There were 3 special events/programs for women in science: (1) FACTS "Suggestions for Becoming a More Productive Academic Writer-Follow Up Discussion", (2) FACTS "More Effective & Efficient Email Management", and (3) FACTS Follow Up Discussion "More Effective & Efficient Email Management".

#### Specific Aim 2

*Develop formal programs that serve as "on-ramps" to introduce C/T research to early or new investigators and trainees at different career stages.*

The PD core reported 8 scholars with 7 professional development activities: (1) Midhun Malla, Conflict management, (2) Samantha Minc, Virginias Vascular Study Group Regional Meeting, (3) Samantha Minc, PI Academy, (4) Samantha Minc, Research Scholars meetings and lectures, (5) Samantha Minc, Opioid CME, (6) Amanda Gaulke, R03 Grant Writing Workshop and (7) Toni Rudisill, American College of University Educators Advanced Teaching Course. There were 0 CTS Certificate students enrolled, 0 new students, and 0 application received. WVU MS in CTS had a total enrollment of 30, with 7 applications received (6 accepted/offer extended) and had 5 students completed the program in Q4. MU MS in CTS did not report data this quarter. CTS PhD program had 7 current enrollments, 0 applications received or reviewed, 1 accepted, and 2 degrees conferred during Q4. Education programming reported no new academic courses, 0 research workshops/short courses, 9 C/T research seminars, 167 unique participants in educational programming from WVU (153), MU (5), CAMC (3), and SOM (4).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Develop educational opportunities to support and retain externally funded C/T researchers statewide.*

The Professional Development core contributed to 14 external funding proposals (over 10.77 USD M): 11 of which were standalone (totaling over 8.28 USD M) and 3 of which were collaborative (totaling over 2.48 USD M): ADMIN (2), and CRDEB (1). The Professional Development core supported 4 standalone external funding awards (totaling over 3.26 USD M), and 3 collaborative linked publications with CRDEB (1), Admin (1), and Pilots (1).

#### Specific Aim 1

*Develop Investigator Tracking and Support System (ITSS) utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors contributing to success or providing barriers to productivity.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Core (TEC) identified all publications linked to WVCTSI grant numbers directly from NCBI and created a [web-based table](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} displaying this information publicly, as well as [Social Network Analysis visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/networkacross/){target="blank"} to show collaboration among authors on linked publications.
TEC completed and disseminated the Awareness Survey report in Q4.

TEC continues to refine the quarterly progress report through which all individuals who receive support/ services from WVCTSI are requested to report information on activity and products generated.
TEC rolled out a user-friendly data portal through which stakeholders can utilize progress report data.
TEC utilizes an ORCID iD survey to gather WVCTSI member [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/){target="blank"}s survey to gather WVCTSI member ORCID iDs to be added to membership list, which currently includes ORCID iD for 495 members (14% of 3,437).
This allows more accurate searches for publications by members that should be linked to the grant.
TEC met with the Professional Development Core to develop an evaluation plan for the Fellows Research Academy pilot project including implementation of a service utilization survey and is currently working on a post-participation survey.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create and implement systematic set of tools and measurements to drive continuous quality improvement and demonstrate impact of community stakeholder participation and engagement.*

TEC continued to work with CEO, WVPBRN, and ECHO on the ECHO "SuperHub" and WVPBRN evaluation plans.
Potential publications for the ECHO project are currently being conceptualized. TEC met with CEO to discuss collecting collaboration among WVPBRN sites. TEC will develop and present a collaboration survey at the WVPBRN retreat to collect this data. In collecting information through the quarterly progress report mentioned above, we were able to identify additional publications that should be linked to the WVCTSI grant numbers. TEC will continue to work with PD and Admin to make improvements and increase efficiency in analyzing such data. TEC continues to make updates to the [new website](https://percwv.com/){target="blank"} that houses a) all tracking and evaluation reports years 6 through current (password protected), b) an automated linked publications hub with counts, full references, and abstracts (publicly available), c) social network visualizations of linked publication author networks (publicly available), and d) the quarterly progress report data portal (password protected).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Build focused research and evaluation demonstrating WVCTSI impacts on health outcomes in West Virginia.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Report for the 3rd Quarter of Y9 was disseminated in Q4 and discussed at a WVCTSI Steering Committee meeting. The ECHO and WVPBRN research evaluation plans when completed will demonstrate impact on health outcomes.
Additionally, TEC core member Malayna Bernstein served as qualitative methodology consultant designing qualitative instrumentation and mentoring research associates conducting interviews and data analysis for the recently awarded supplement: "Developing Novel Strategies to Increase COVID-19 Testing among Underserved and Vulnerable Populations in West Virginia through Community and State Partnerships." NIH Award No. [3U54GM104942-05S3](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10233444){target="blank"} (Total Awarded: 4,999,989 USD).
