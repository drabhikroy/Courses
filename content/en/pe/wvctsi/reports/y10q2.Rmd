### Executive Summary and Key Recommendations

This is the quarterly tracking and evaluation report of the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) for the 2nd quarter (Q2) of fiscal year 2021/2022 (Y10), which covers a reporting period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.

The WVCTSI received Y10 renewal notice of award dated June 30, 2021 with an annual award of <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>4,000,000 for the budget period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and a total project period from August 15, 2012 through June 30, 2022.

This report prepared by WVCTSI Tracking and Evaluation Core personnel is organized by specific aim within each key component area/core plus information from partner institutions as available.
This report does not describe every tracking and evaluation metric in each core, rather key elements and recommendations are summarized and readers are referred to the Quarterly Data Sheet (Excel) distributed with this report for information on all metrics as reported by all cores and partners.

At the close of the reporting period, there were 23 peer-reviewed publications including 5 in press that were officially linked to WVCTSI funding, 13 presentations, 41 external funding proposals totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>42.4 million, and 40 funded awards totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>3.3 million for quarter 2 of year 10.

#### Overall recommendations from Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Prepare to close out cycle 2 (years 6-10) funding period by June 30, 2022. Develop contingency plans for institutionalization of activities as feasible should renewal funding not be awarded. Simultaneously, develop planning activities to "hit the ground running" in the event that the renewal funding application is successful.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Develop process to set annual dashboard targets prior to the start of each fiscal year utilizing patterns of change in overall dashboard metrics across previous funding years.
-   Set core-specific annual targets for year 10.
-   Host partner-focused WVCTSI leadership discussions to generate additional ideas and action items to engage each partner and meet their needs better over time. Include at least the following considerations: supporting [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) usage, linking publications, supporting competitive pilot award applications, iLabs utilization, targeted advertising and training related to WVCTSI service utilization by personnel at each partner organization, and regular communications channels through which partners and associated investigators make their needs and preferences known.
-   Revisit effort to date and consider next steps to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core

-   Plan and conduct professional development trainings targeted at increasing service utilization generally by investigators at each partner site. Additionally, consider why no GIS consultations were engaged this quarter and specifically target removing any barriers to that service being delivered / utilized in the future.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

-   Consider whether effort should be directed at supporting activation of TriNetX studies, and if so develop detail plans to help accepted studies become activated.

#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement and Outreach Core

-   Review all metrics with low or zero activity this quarter, which are mostly in new project/collaboration areas, and determine whether that is appropriate given the approaching end of the funding period or what efforts may be needed to increase activity in the future.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

-   Review activity to date and consider whether additional effort should be targeted at supporting funded pilot awardees completing their scope of work by June 30, 2022.

#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

-   Set core-specific annual targets for year 10.
-   Discontinue the CTS Certificate program because there has been no enrollment since Q3Y9 and enrollment headcount has varied from 0-3 students throughout this funding cycle.

#### Key Recommendations to Technology and Resources for Core Laboratories Core

-   Set core-specific annual targets for year 10.
-   Consider whether additional effort should be directed toward activation of genomics studies or WVU collecting and utilizing biospecimen samples.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

-   Review all metrics alignment to specific aims and consider implications for quarterly reporting during the current funding cycle ending 6/30/2022. Conduct similar analysis related to specific aims in renewal application and prepare for evaluation changes beginning 7/1/2022.
-   Support continued refinement of the publication reporting process, including identification of publications that should be linked to the grant and supporting roll-out of [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) utilization.
-   Continue to refine the progress report and related data portal for use by PD, Pilot, and Admin cores to collect quarterly report information from individuals receiving WVCTSI services, protected time, or other support.
-   Begin building web-based membership database as first step toward an integrated member service utilization and productivity database.

#### Key Recommendations to Marshall University, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine

-   CAMC should set annual targets for year 10.
-   Work with Administration Core to help ensure partner organization perspectives related to how best to engage investigators and other personnel at each site are made clear.
-   Continue efforts to increase WVCTSI membership, awareness, and utilization of WVCTSI core services at each partner institution.

### Administrative Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Administrative.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Implement an effective operational structure that facilitates attainment of all proposed WVCTSI Specific Aims and projects.*

WVCTSI had 41 external funding proposals (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>42.4 million) and 40 funded awards (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>3.29 million) during Y10 Q2.
Of these Admin was directly linked to 17 external funding proposals (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>25.1 million) and 7 external awards (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>2.2 million) this quarter.
Figures 1 and 2 show types of external funding proposed and awarded per cores contributing.
WVCTSI Staff numbers in Q2 is 72.

*Note: Numbers of linked publications do not include those that were embargoed at the time these data were pulled. Publications are categorized as "published" and "in-press".*

It should be noted that linking publications requires substantial effort and lags real time.
While the total number of linked publications typically lags the annual target, it is on-track based on trends observed in past years where the number of publications continues to rise after a reporting period has ended.
Accordingly, the number of linked publications at the time the reporting period closed and for which core contributions are reported here will be fewer than those reported in the table above because additional publications continue to be linked daily.
While the current number of linked publications is higher, there were 23 publications, including 5 in press, linked to the grant at the close of Quarter 2.
Cores and partners contributed to the following number of those linked publications each: 5 ADMIN, 10 CRDEB, 2 CRRF, 1 Pilot, 8 PD, and 3 TECH.
These counts do not add up to 23 due to multiple cores being linked with several publications.
Core contributions to linked publications are displayed in Figure 3.

##### *Figure 3. Contributions per core to Y10Q2 WVCTSI linked publications. Download a copy of the [publication](/graphics/Y10Q2/pubs.pdf){target="blank"} visualization as a high quality PDF.*

Tracking and Evaluation Core pulled linked publications from NCBI utilizing all appropriate grant numbers to accurately identify which publications should be considered linked to the grant in this and all previous quarters.
The WVCTSI Linked Publications Hub displays officially linked publications associated with each quarterly reporting period.
"In press" numbers are additional linked publications with a current status of "ahead of print" that are expected to be published at some point and remain linked to the grant.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create policies and procedures to drive performance, transparency, constructive communication and collaboration among multiple, diverse stakeholders (i.e., investigators, rural providers, community members).*

Administration Core reported having 68,863 [website](https://www.wvctsi.org/){target="blank"} visitor hits, with an average of 323.5 website visitors per day during Q2, however these numbers do not include the month of October due to technical difficulties.

WVCTSI's social media engagement reported in Q2 includes: 11 [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WVCTSI/){target="blank"} New Likes (with a total of 475 Likes), 88 New Followers (555 total followers), 12 new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} followers (726 followers total), 9 new [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wvctsi/){target="blank"} followers (140 total), 1.25K [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} Subscribers with a total of +156k views and 131 new General Interest Mailing List subscribers (3701 total).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Provide sound fiscal and resource management, ensuring appropriate resourcing of cores, flexibility to meet changing needs and environments, and sustainability of services.*

As noted above, WVCTSI supported 41 external funding proposals and 40 external awards this quarter.
Percentage of NIH award expended ranged between 11% and 33% in Q2 with Admin being the lowest and TEC being the highest.
There were 5 cost transfers/corrections reported this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 4

*Recruit talented, committed investigators addressing research questions relevant to the WVCTSI priority health areas.*

No Clinical Translational investigators were reported as hired this quarter, however 1 new WVCTSI staff was reported as being hired in Q2.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Develop process to set annual dashboard targets prior to the start of each fiscal year utilizing patterns of change in overall dashboard metrics across previous funding years.
-   Set core-specific annual targets for year 10.
-   Host partner-focused WVCTSI leadership discussions to generate additional ideas and action items to engage each partner and meet their needs better over time. Include at least the following considerations: supporting [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) usage, linking publications, supporting competitive pilot award applications, iLabs utilization, targeted advertising and training related to WVCTSI service utilization by personnel at each partner organization, and regular communications channels through which partners and associated investigators make their needs and preferences known.
-   Revisit effort to date and consider next steps to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.

##### *Figure 4. CRDEB iLab Core Management System services logged by month and service type. Download a copy of the [CRDEB visualization](/graphics/Y10Q2/crdeb.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 2

*Implement cutting-edge tools and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology, with a particular focus on the needs of WV researchers.*

CRDEB reported 58 BMIR-related inquiries, 16 new CRDEB consultations, 3 sample size/power consultations, 16 new statistical analysis consultations, and 7 new clinical study design consultations in Q2.
Additionally, 327.75 hours were dedicated to biostatistics consultations.
Zero GIS analysis consultations were reported for Q2.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Disseminate current and classical information in biostatistics and epidemiology*

There were 10 linked publications supported by CRDEB, where 6 were standalone and 4 were supported in collaboration with other cores; ADMIN, TECH, and PD.
CRDEB contributed to 2 external funding proposals collaboratively with other cores for <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>13.2 million in Q2.
CRDEB supported 2 external funding awards (totaling <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>36,000 in Q2), both of which were standalone.

#### Specific Aim 4[^1]

[^1]: CRDEB Specific Aim 4 was previously CRRF Specific Aim 2.This revision was specified by letter to NIH dated November 27, 2017 and subsequently approved.

*Leverage the newly enhanced Integrated Data Repository (IDR2) and partnership through the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC) to facilitate outcomes research, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis.*

There were 14 new custom IDR dataset requests, 2 requests for updates to previous IDR datasets, and 6 IDR projects reported as completed in Q2.
There were 277.25 hours spent on new data requests, 21.75 hours on updates to previous data sets and 0 hours data request consultation.
CRDEB did not report any activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC).

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

-   Plan and conduct professional development trainings targeted at increasing service utilization generally by investigators at each partner site. Additionally, consider why no GIS consultations were engaged this quarter and specifically target removing any barriers to that service being delivered / utilized in the future.

##### *Figure 6. CRRF OnCore studies by month Download as copy of the [CRRF visualization](/graphics/Y10Q2/crrf_studies_plot.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create a Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (CTCOE) with connection to rural communities and practitioners, thereby providing access to cutting-edge trials addressing health disparities affecting West Virginians.*

In Q2, CTCOE provided 142 unique instances of support to non-WVCTSI studies in the form of regulatory assistance (44), study coordination (36), accounting (61), and quality assurance audits (1).
Within the expanded activities by CTCOE (established Q2Y8) which included Registration, a Risk Assessment Committee, and an Appeals Committee; there were 14 trials approved, 8 trials reviewed, and 8 approved by the risk assessment committee.
CRRF supported 2 new Early-Stage PI's.
CTCOE supported 2 WVCTSI-initiated trials in new research areas.
35 participants were enrolled, with 26 more completing a study.
CRRF had 20 TriNetX study offers and 4 accepted at WVU, with 0 studies activated in Q2.
CRRF reported 4 PI Academy events and 3 new PI Academy members.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Establish the Environmental Exposures Unit to stimulate environmental health research in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).*

While there has been some activity with NIOSH personnel, there have been no data reported on the Environmental Exposures Unit since the beginning of this funding cycle (2016).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

-   Consider whether effort should be directed at supporting activation of TriNetX studies, and if so develop detail plans to help accepted studies become activated.

### Community Engagement and Outreach Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Community_Engagement.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Actively engage patients and other community stakeholders as research partners.*

There were 112 WVPBRN and 208 ECHO sites reported in Q2.
This included new ECHO sites: (1) Holston Medical Group - Duffield, VA, (2) Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center - Lubbock, TX , (3) St. David's Hospital - Austin, TX, (4) Centerville Clinics - Donora, PA, (5) WVU Eastern Division - Martinsburg, WV, (6) North Central WV Black Lung Program - Newburg, WV, (7) JBS International - Rockville, MD, (8) Tennessee Department of Health - Nashville, TN , (9) NEOMED - Rootstown, OH, and (10) Barbour Community Health Association - Belington, WV .
There were 0 new partner organizations reported in Q2.
During Q2, there were 0 new CEO (non-ECHO) projects and 0 new ECHO projects reported.
CEO reported 0 networking opportunities.
There was 1 Community Advisory Board meeting attempted that was delayed due to holidays.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Transform community-identified research questions into externally-funded projects that improve health outcomes in WVCTSI health priority areas.*

There were 3 new, 36 ongoing, and 2 completed WVPBRN projects as well as 0 new, 2 ongoing, and 0 completed CEO projects.
0 WVPBRN projects were reviewed and 2 accepted in Q2.
There were, 12 Community Engagement and Training services, 224 Project Implementation services, 99 Project Development and Success services, 1 new Ideas on Deck service, 9 Consultation services, 32 WVPBRN Activities, 0 funding opportunity identified, 162 hours of ECHO services, and 8 services for products reported during Q2.
CEO didn't contribute to any publications in Q2.
CEO contributed to 5 external funding proposals (totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>16.4 million) in Q2, 2 stand alone and 3 in collaboration (3 ADMIN, 3 CRRF, and 1 CRDEB), and contributed to 1 standalone funding award for <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>800,000.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Translate and disseminate research results to inform West Virginia health policy and practice.*

In Q2, there were 11 Research Translation and Dissemination services, 0 practice changes, and 0 policy changes or policy project briefs reported.

### Tracking and Evaluation Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Tracking_and_Evaluation.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Develop Investigator Tracking and Support System (ITSS) utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors contributing to success or providing barriers to productivity.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Core (TEC) identified all publications linked to WVCTSI grant numbers directly from NCBI and created a [web-based table](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} displaying this information publicly, as well as [Social Network Analysis visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/networkacross/){target="blank"} to show collaboration among authors on linked publications.
TEC also substantially revised the formatting of [web-based quarterly evaluation reports](https://percwv.com/reports/){target="blank"} to aid usability and utilization.

TEC continues to refine the quarterly progress report through which all individuals who receive support / services from WVCTSI are requested to report information on activity and products generated.
TEC updated a [user-friendly data portal](https://percwv.com/reports/portal2/){target="blank"} through which stakeholders can utilize progress report data.

TEC utilizes an ORCID ID survey to gather WVCTSI member ORCID ID's to be added to membership list, which currently includes ORCID ID for 561 members (14% of 3,921) following a recent quality control cleaning of duplicates and inaccurate entries.
TEC developed a method of identifying member publications and pulling their ORCID ID's in reverse order.
This allows more accurate searches for publications by members that should be linked to the grant.
TEC developed a survey for the Fellows Research Academy pilot project and is awaiting feedback.

TEC continues work on the new membership database.
Once completed this database will house member information, services received, and outputs (i.e., publications, grant proposals, funded awards).
This database will be made available to all WVCTSI staff to allow verification of membership and a record of services/outputs.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create and implement systematic set of tools and measurements to drive continuous quality improvement and demonstrate impact of community stakeholder participation and engagement.*

In collecting information through the quarterly progress report mentioned above, we were able to identify additional publications that should be linked to the WVCTSI grant numbers.
TEC will continue to work with PD and Admin to make improvements and increase efficiency in analyzing such data.
TEC continues to make updates to the [website](https://percwv.com/){target="blank"} that houses a) all tracking and evaluation [reports](https://percwv.com/login/){target="blank"} years 6 through current (password protected), b) an automated [linked publications hub](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} with counts, full references, and abstracts (publicly available), c) [social network visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/){target="blank"} of linked publication author networks (publicly available), and d) the [quarterly progress report data portal](https://percwv.com/reports/portal2/){target="blank"} (password protected).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Build focused research and evaluation demonstrating WVCTSI impacts on health outcomes in West Virginia.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Report for the 1st Quarter of Y10 was disseminated in Q2.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core
