### Executive Summary and Key Recommendations

This is the quarterly tracking and evaluation report of the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) for the 3rd quarter (Q3) of fiscal year 2021/2022 (Y10), which covers a reporting period from January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2022.

The WVCTSI received Y10 renewal notice of award dated June 30, 2021 with an annual award of <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>4,000,000 for the budget period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and a total project period from August 15, 2012 through June 30, 2022.

This report prepared by WVCTSI Tracking and Evaluation Core personnel is organized by specific aim within each key component area/core plus information from partner institutions as available.
This report does not describe every tracking and evaluation metric in each core, rather key elements and recommendations are summarized and readers are referred to the Quarterly Data Sheet (Excel) distributed with this report for information on all metrics as reported by all cores and partners.

At the close of the reporting period, there were 11 peer-reviewed publications including 1 in press that were officially linked to WVCTSI funding, 2 presentations, 59 external funding proposals totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>42.4 million, and 40 funded awards totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>4.1 million for quarter 3 of year 10.

#### Overall recommendations from Tracking and Evaluation Core

- Close out cycle 2 (years 6-10) funding period by June 30, 2022. 
- Develop contingency plans for institutionalization of activities as feasible, and engage in planning activities to “hit the ground running” should renewal funding be awarded.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

- Develop process to set annual dashboard targets prior to the start of each fiscal year utilizing patterns of change in overall dashboard metrics across previous funding years.
- Host partner-focused WVCTSI leadership discussions to generate additional ideas and action items to engage each partner and meet their needs better over time. Include at least the following considerations: supporting [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) usage, linking publications, supporting competitive pilot award applications, iLabs utilization, targeted advertising and training related to WVCTSI service utilization by personnel at each partner organization, and regular communications channels through which partners and associated investigators make their needs and preferences known.
- Continue efforts to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core

- Plan and conduct professional development trainings targeted at increasing service utilization generally by investigators at each partner site. Additionally, consider why no GIS consultations were engaged this quarter and specifically target removing any barriers to that service being delivered / utilized in the future.

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

- Consider innovative ways in which CRRF might contribute to linked publications and supporting early-stage PI’s.

#### Key Recommendations to Community Engagement and Outreach Core

- Review all metrics with low or zero activity this quarter, which are mostly in new project/collaboration areas, and determine whether that is appropriate given the approaching end of the funding period or what efforts may be needed to increase activity in preparation for a new funding cycle should renewal funding be awarded.

#### Key Recommendations to Pilot Projects Core

- Review activity to date and consider whether additional effort should be targeted at supporting funded pilot awardees completing their scope of work by June 30, 2022, as well as how to best prepare for a new funding cycle should renewal funding be awarded.

#### Key Recommendations to Professional Development Core

- Set core-specific annual targets for year 10.
- Discontinue the CTS Certificate program because there has been no enrollment since Q3Y9 and enrollment headcount has varied from 0-3 students throughout this funding cycle..

#### Key Recommendations to Technology and Resources for Core Laboratories Core

- Consider whether additional effort should be directed toward WVU and CAMC collecting and utilizing biospecimen samples.

#### Key Recommendations to Tracking and Evaluation Core

- Review all metrics alignment to specific aims and consider implications for quarterly reporting during the current funding cycle ending 6/30/2022. Conduct similar analysis related to specific aims in renewal application and prepare for evaluation changes beginning 7/1/2022.
- Continue building web-based membership database toward an integrated member service utilization and productivity database.

#### Key Recommendations to Marshall University, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine

- CAMC should set annual targets for year 10.
- Work with Administration Core to help ensure partner organization perspectives related to how best to engage investigators and other personnel at each site are made clear.
- Continue efforts to increase WVCTSI membership, awareness, and utilization of WVCTSI core services at each partner institution..

### Administrative Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Administrative.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Implement an effective operational structure that facilitates attainment of all proposed WVCTSI Specific Aims and projects.*

WVCTSI had 59 external funding proposals (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>39.88 million) and 24 funded awards (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>4.17 million) during Y10 Q3.
Of these Admin was directly linked to 19 external funding proposals (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>19.1 million) and 4 external awards (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>667K) this quarter.
Figures 1 and 2 show types of external funding proposed and awarded per cores contributing.
WVCTSI Staff numbers in Q3 is 67.

Tracking and Evaluation Core pulled linked publications from NCBI utilizing all appropriate grant numbers to accurately identify which publications should be considered linked to the grant in this and all previous quarters.
The WVCTSI Linked Publications Hub displays officially linked publications associated with each quarterly reporting period.
"In press" numbers are additional linked publications with a current status of "ahead of print" that are expected to be published at some point and remain linked to the grant.

*How to Use the App: Clicking on the three lines will open or close the menu. With the menu open, selecting* **Publication Counts** *on the left panel will display today's totals and* **Linked Publications** *will provide a list of all publications linked to WVCTSI registered with NCBI. For additional room, please select the three lines to expand the viewing area. Publication counts may be downloaded in various formats as by clicking the `CSV`, `Excel`, or `PDF` buttons while linked publications can be downloaded as a filtered or complete `.csv` table.*

*Note: Numbers of linked publications do not include those that were embargoed at the time these data were pulled. Publications are categorized as "published" and "in-press".*

It should be noted that linking publications requires substantial effort and lags real time.
While the total number of linked publications typically lags the annual target, it is on-track based on trends observed in past years where the number of publications continues to rise after a reporting period has ended.
Accordingly, the number of linked publications at the time the reporting period closed and for which core contributions are reported here will be fewer than those reported in the table above because additional publications continue to be linked daily.
While the current number of linked publications is higher, there were 11 publications linked to the grant at the close of Quarter 3. Cores and partners contributed to the following number of those linked publications each: 2 ADMIN, 6 CRDEB, 1 Pilot, 2 PD, and 3 TECH.
These counts do not add up to 11 due to multiple cores being linked with several publications. Core contributions to linked publications are displayed in Figure 3.

##### *Figure 3. Contributions per core to Y10Q3 WVCTSI linked publications. Download a copy of the [publication](/graphics/Y10Q3/pubs.pdf){target="blank"} visualization as a high quality PDF.*

In order to address the concern that WVCTSI may be supporting publications that are not being appropriately identified and linked to the grant, TEC pulls publications from appropriate public databases (e.g., PubMed) utilizing ORCID ID’s when available and full names on the WVCTSI member list when ORCID ID’s are not available then limiting the search to publications during the current funding period. The list from the name-based search is reduced by including only those publications with author institutional affiliations in West Virginia. Core leadership review the list and contact all first authors regarding whether their publication should be linked to the grant. TEC continues to use the quarterly progress report through which publications, among several other types of information, are requested from all individuals who receive WVCTSI services or support.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create policies and procedures to drive performance, transparency, constructive communication and collaboration among multiple, diverse stakeholders (i.e., investigators, rural providers, community members).*

Administration Core reported having 127,114 [website](https://www.wvctsi.org/){target="blank"} visitor hits, with an average of 399.3 website visitors per day during Q3.

WVCTSI's social media engagement reported in Q3 includes: 5 [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WVCTSI/){target="blank"} New Likes (with a total of 475 Likes), 7 New Followers (555 total followers), 11 new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} followers (737 followers total), 6 new [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wvctsi/){target="blank"} followers (146 total), 1.32K [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/WVCTSI){target="blank"} Subscribers with a total of 164.6K views and 105 new General Interest Mailing List subscribers (3806 total).

#### Specific Aim 3

*Provide sound fiscal and resource management, ensuring appropriate resourcing of cores, flexibility to meet changing needs and environments, and sustainability of services.*

As noted above, WVCTSI supported 59 external funding proposals and 24 external awards this quarter.
Percentage of NIH award expended ranged between 2% and 41% in Q3 with CRDEB being the lowest and TEC being the highest.
There were 8 cost transfers/corrections reported this quarter.

#### Specific Aim 4

*Recruit talented, committed investigators addressing research questions relevant to the WVCTSI priority health areas.*

No Clinical Translational investigators were reported as hired this quarter, however 2 new WVCTSI staff were reported as being hired in Q3.

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

- Develop process to set annual dashboard targets prior to the start of each fiscal year utilizing patterns of change in overall dashboard metrics across previous funding years.
- Host partner-focused WVCTSI leadership discussions to generate additional ideas and action items to engage each partner and meet their needs better over time. Include at least the following considerations: supporting ORCID iD usage, linking publications, supporting competitive pilot award applications, iLabs utilization, targeted advertising and training related to WVCTSI service utilization by personnel at each partner organization, and regular communications channels through which partners and associated investigators make their needs and preferences known.
- Continue efforts to get all WVCTSI members who generate scholarly publications to have an ORCID ID as part of their WVCTSI membership profile.

##### *Figure 4. CRDEB iLab Core Management System services logged by month and service type. Download a copy of the [CRDEB visualization](/graphics/Y10Q3/crdeb.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 2

*Implement cutting-edge tools and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology, with a particular focus on the needs of WV researchers.*

CRDEB reported 52 BMIR-related inquiries, 28 new unique CRDEB consultations, 2 sample size/power consultations, 23 new statistical analysis consultations, and 11 new clinical study design consultations in Q3. Additionally, 440.25 hours were dedicated to biostatistics consultations. Zero GIS analysis consultations were reported for Q3.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Disseminate current and classical information in biostatistics and epidemiology*

There were 6 linked publications supported by CRDEB, where 3 were standalone and 3 were supported in collaboration with other cores: ADMIN (1) and PD (2). CRDEB contributed to 1 external funding proposals for <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>2.3 million in Q3.
CRDEB supported 5 external funding awards (totaling <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>1.8 million in Q3), 4 of which were standalone and 1 in collaboration with PD.

#### Specific Aim 4[^1]

[^1]: CRDEB Specific Aim 4 was previously CRRF Specific Aim 2.This revision was specified by letter to NIH dated November 27, 2017 and subsequently approved.

*Leverage the newly enhanced Integrated Data Repository (IDR2) and partnership through the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC) to facilitate outcomes research, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis.*

There were 13 new custom IDR dataset requests, 4 requests for updates to previous IDR datasets, and 16 IDR projects reported as completed in Q3.
There were 166.25 hours spent on new data requests, 16 hours on updates to previous data sets and 0 hours data request consultation.
CRDEB did not report any activity related to the Appalachian Research Consortium (ARC).

#### Key Recommendations to Administrative Core

- Plan and conduct professional development trainings targeted at increasing service utilization generally by investigators at each partner site. Additionally, consider why no GIS consultations were engaged this quarter and specifically target removing any barriers to that service being delivered / utilized in the future.

##### *Figure 6. CRRF OnCore studies by month Download as copy of the [CRRF visualization](/graphics/Y10Q3/crrf_studies_plot.pdf){target="blank"} as a high quality PDF.*

#### Specific Aim 1

*Create a Clinical Trials Center of Excellence (CTCOE) with connection to rural communities and practitioners, thereby providing access to cutting-edge trials addressing health disparities affecting West Virginians.*

In Q3, CTCOE provided 138 unique instances of support to non-WVCTSI studies in the form of regulatory assistance (44), study coordination (38), accounting (56), and quality assurance audits (0). 
Within the expanded activities by CTCOE (established Q3Y8) which included Registration, a Risk Assessment Committee, and an Appeals Committee; there were 22 trials approved, 7 trials reviewed, and 7 approved by the risk assessment committee. 
CRRF supported 0 new Early-Stage PI’s. 
CTCOE supported 0 WVCTSI-initiated trials in new research areas. 
136 participants were enrolled, with 23 more completing a study. 
CRRF had 12 TriNetX study offers and 4 accepted at WVU, with 1 study activated in Q3. 
CRRF reported 1 PI Academy events and 6 new PI Academy members.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Establish the Environmental Exposures Unit to stimulate environmental health research in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).*

While there has been some activity with NIOSH personnel, there have been no data reported on the Environmental Exposures Unit since the beginning of this funding cycle (2016).

#### Key Recommendations to Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core

- Consider innovative ways in which CRRF might contribute to linked publications and supporting early-stage PI’s.

### Community Engagement and Outreach Core

![](/reports/01-report_files/Community_Engagement.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Actively engage patients and other community stakeholders as research partners.*

There were 112 WVPBRN and 254 ECHO sites reported in Q3. This included 46 new ECHO sites: (1) AbbVie pharmaceuticals (IL), (2) Community Education Group, (3) WVU Tech, (4) WVU OHSR, (5) WVU Institute of Technology, (6) WVU College of Business and Economics, (7) WV Collegiate Recovery Network, (8) WV Prevention Solutions, (9) Wheeling University, (10) West Virginia Wesleyan College, (11) West Virginia University Institute of Technology, (12) West Virginia University – Parkersburg, (13) West Virginia University – PSC, (14) West Virginia State University, (15) West Virginia Northern Community College, (16) West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, (17) West Virginia Drug Intervention Institution, (18) West Liberty University, (19) University of Charleston, (20) The Jed Foundation (CT), (21) Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College, (22) Shepherd University, (23) SELF, (24) Potomac State College of WVU, (25) Northwestern Medicine (IL), (26) New River Community and Technical College, (27) Fairmont State University, (28) Davis and Elkins College, (29) Concord University , (30) Center for Learning, Advising, and Student Success, (31) WVU Carruth Center, (32) Bridge Valley Community and Technical College, (33) Bluefield State University, (34) Blue Ridge Community and Technical College ,(35) Alderson Broaddus University, (36) West Virginia University, (37) Annex Kanawha City Health Care, (38) Hampshire County Pathways, (39) Garrett County Health Department - Early Care Programs (MD), (40) West Virginia Sober Living, (41) River Valley Child Development Services, (42) New River Parents as Teachers, (43) St. Mary's Women and Family Care, (44) Stonebelt/RCA (IN), (45) Peak Health ,and (46) The Marvel Center. There were 2 new partner organizations reported in Q3: (1) WV Sheriff’s Association and (2) Mountaineer Health Clinic.

During Q3, there were 0 new CEO (non-ECHO) projects and 3 new ECHO projects reported. There was 1 Community Advisory Board meeting and 1 ECHO superhub immersion organization was trained (WV Cancer Institute 21 trainees), and 3 CAB related services reported.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Transform community-identified research questions into externally-funded projects that improve health outcomes in WVCTSI health priority areas.*

There were 11 new, 41 ongoing, and 3 completed WVPBRN projects as well as 0 new, 1 ongoing, and 0 completed CEO projects. 14 WVPBRN projects were reviewed and 11 accepted in Q3. There were, 20 Community Engagement and Training services, 356 Project Implementation services, 124 Project Development and Success services, 1 new Design Studio service, 13 Consultation services, 17 WVPBRN Activities, 1 funding opportunity identified, 214 ECHO services, and 16 services for products reported during Q3. CEO didn’t contribute to any publications in Q3. CEO contributed to 4 external funding proposals (totaling over <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>2.289 million) in Q3, 2 stand alone and 3 in collaboration (3 ADMIN, 3 CRRF, and 1 CRDEB), all of which stand alone, and contributed to 3 standalone funding awards for <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>884,778.

#### Specific Aim 3

*Translate and disseminate research results to inform West Virginia health policy and practice.*

In Q3, there were 40 Research Translation and Dissemination services, 1 internal and 1 external practice changes, and 0 policy changes or policy project briefs reported.

### Tracking and Evaluation Core {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

![](/reports/01-report_files/Tracking_and_Evaluation.png){width="30%"}

#### Specific Aim 1

*Develop Investigator Tracking and Support System (ITSS) utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify factors contributing to success or providing barriers to productivity.*

The Tracking and Evaluation Core (TEC) identified all publications linked to WVCTSI grant numbers directly from NCBI. The [web-based table](https://percwv.com/datatables/pubs/){target="blank"} displaying publication information publicly is automatically updated daily and was augmented with the number of citations per linked publications each year. [Social Network Analysis visualizations](https://percwv.com/visualizations/networkacross/){target="blank"} show collaboration among authors on linked publications.

TEC continues to refine the quarterly progress report through which all individuals who receive support/ services from WVCTSI are requested to report information on activity and products generated. TEC updates the [user-friendly data portal](https://percwv.com/reports/portal2/){target="blank"} quarterly through which stakeholders can utilize progress report data. TEC met with the PD and CRRF cores during this quarter to streamline the quarterly reporting process.  TEC is assisting the PD core with updating their iLab profile, have gained access to COE data through KC, and are supporting PD core with targeted evaluations of specific activities described below.

TEC utilizes an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) survey to gather WVCTSI member ORCID ID's to be added to membership list, which currently includes ORCID ID for 578 members following a recent quality control cleaning of duplicates and inaccurate entries.TEC developed a method of identifying member publications and pulling author ORCID ID from those publications to augment those provided to us by WVCTSI members. This also allows more accurate searches for publications by members that should be linked to the grant. 

TEC worked with the PD core to evaluate several current projects. The INTRO survey report was finalized this quarter and they began work on the Fellows Research Academy evaluation. Phase I of the Fellows Research Academy evaluation was to conduct interviews with the directors and advisors of this group. Five interviews were conducted and transcribed, with a report to follow.  Phase II which includes information collected from the fellows began this quarter with the creation of a survey.  The survey will be distributed next quarter with a report to follow. TEC began conceptualizing the evaluation of 2 future events for PD, Creating Connections: An Introduction to the Alda Method and Nature Master Classes. Those surveys will be distributed during quarter 4. 

TEC continues work on the new membership database.  Once completed this database will house member information, services received, and outputs (i.e., publications, grant proposals, funded awards). This database will be made available to all WVCTSI staff to allow verification of membership and a record of services/outputs.

#### Specific Aim 2

*Create and implement systematic set of tools and measurements to drive continuous quality improvement and demonstrate impact of community stakeholder participation and engagement.*

In collecting information through the quarterly progress report mentioned above, we were able to identify additional publications that should be linked to the WVCTSI grant numbers.
