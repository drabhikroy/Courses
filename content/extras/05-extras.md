## Open Psychometrics

1. If you are interested in playing with the Open-Source Psychometrics Project data, click [here](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/).

2. Can't get enough of psychometrics tests or want to see a somewhat different selection of tests? The UK has its own version of an open psychometrics site [Psychometric Tests](https://www.psychometrictest.org.uk/). 

3. Like personality tests but dislike the [bland look](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/) of the one found on the Open-Source Psychometrics Project? Here is an aesthetically pleasing version of the [Big Five personality questionnaire](https://tests.mettl.com/v2/authenticateKey/40p8c0o1z4) that may be just what you're looking for.
