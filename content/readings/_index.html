<p>Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> doing anything else. It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said, think of the text as a reference, in that</p>
<ul>
<li>it contains a lot of information that you may use but probably not right now, and</li>
<li>it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.</p>

<p>There’s no such thing as visual learner or any other kind of learner <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/edu-a0037478.pdf" target="_blank">(Rogowsky, Calhoun &amp; Tallal, 2015)</a>. With that said, reinforcement using different mediums such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc helps. These however take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Is the production quality Hollywood? No because I’m a professor at a public university who doesn’t sound like Morgan Freeman, have three children and drive a car with duct tape on it BUT they’ll be decent. I am always open to suggestions so if you have any, please send them along!</p>

<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that’s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="https://2021edp693g.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>
