### Review

Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop so you should probably go read the [Syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible! Additionally please look over the other areas on this site: 

> [Tasks & Deliverables](/tasks/)

> [To do List](/due/)

> [Resources](/resources/)^[If you have questions about any of resources including those that may not apply directly to the course, please feel free to reach out]
