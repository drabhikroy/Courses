## Course Texts

Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** doing anything else. It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said think of the text as a reference, in that

-   it contains a lot of stuff that you may use but not at this very moment, and
-   it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions

So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.

## Complementary Materials

Resources such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc. take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Do the materials have top notch production value? No because I’m not a famous director from Hollywood will millions of dollars. However they should be good enough…even decent. Given that, I am always open to suggestions so if you have any, send them along!
