### Review

Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop, so you should probably go read the [Syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible! Additionally look over the other areas on this site: [Materials](/materials/), [Tasks & Deliverables](/tasks/), [To do List](/due/), and [Resources](/resources/) pages for this class.
