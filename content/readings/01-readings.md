### Review

Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop so you should probably go read the [Syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible! Additionally please look over the other areas on this site:

> [Materials](/materials/)

> [Tasks & Deliverables](/tasks/)

> [To do List](/due/)

> [Resources](/resources/)[^1]
