### Review Website

Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop, so you should probably go read the [syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible! Additionally look over the other areas on this site: [readings](/readings/), [materials](/materials/), [extras](/extras/), [tasks](/tasks/), [to do list](/due/), and [resources](/resources/) pages for this class.
