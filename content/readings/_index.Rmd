Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** doing anything else. It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said think of the text as a reference, in that

- it contains a lot of stuff that you may use but not at this very moment, and
- it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions

So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.
