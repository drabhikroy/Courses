Here are multiple resources and guides related to data, R and other relevant topics. None of these are required readings but could be helpful in or beyond the course!

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30) or contact me within [Slack](https://2021edp613.slack.com) by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
