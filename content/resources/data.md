- [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions where people compete to create the fastest, most efficient, most predictive algorithms. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. 

- [**US City Open Data Census**](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/): More than 100 US cities have committed to sharing dozens of types of data, including data about crime, budgets, campaign finance, lobbying, transit, and zoning.
