## Responses

Read through posts on <font face="Arial Narrow" size="4px">[#pictures-of-evaluation](https://2022edp617.slack.com/archives/C02U0V36SQY)</font> and comment on at least one posting.

## Evaluation Definitions

Look through the [evaluation definitions](/handouts/Evaluation%20Definitions.pdf) document. Think about which of those definitions fits best with your own view of evaluation, or if there are components of your view that are not addressed by any of those definitions. Then write a single post on <font face="Arial Narrow" size="4px">[#evaluation-definitions](https://2022edp617.slack.com/archives/C02V4BM9VQQ)</font> describing your view of evaluation and how it connects with any, all, or none of the definitions described.

## Considering Program Evaluation

Please take and complete the survey ***Considering Program Evaluation*** that has been sent to your e-mail. While I ask that you please fill it out truthfully, please note there is no right or wrong answer. This is just an initial assessment of what you may or may not know or be aware of within the field of evaluation and provides me with an initial benchmark for the class. If you did not receive an invite, please let me know as soon as possible!

### Reminder

Please make sure to look over the [Writing on Slack](/tasks/#writing-on-slack) and [Responding on Slack](/tasks/#responding-on-slack) prior to posting.
