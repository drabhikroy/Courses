## FAQ

### *Is the course content difficult?*
You have likely heard a response like this before:  *...at times some of the material can be hard...* While vague, difficulty is subjective, varies, and will depend on your academic and practical background. Instead, focus on this question:

<center>
<p id="rounded_corners">
Can I search for help independently first and then reach out if needed?
</p>
</center>

If your answer is yes, then you are likely well-positioned to succeed in this class. Make sure to go through the <a href="#rstats"><span style="color:#03dac6"><b>How to Ask for Help with R and RStudio</b></span></a>.

### *Is R difficult?*
Learning `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` can be especially challenging at first—it’s like learning a new language, whether it’s Spanish or even math. Even experienced R users get frustrated—some of us even have swear jars! However, as silly as it sounds, one of the best feelings is overcoming a logical roadblock. So, if you find yourself getting irritated, try this: take a break, step away for a bit, sleep on it, and/or discuss it with a peer. If you are reaching your limit, take a few deep breaths and reach out to me!

### *What if I'm a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner?*
You do not fall into any one of those categories. In fact, there is no widely accepted study that supports a single learning style over another, nor is there solid evidence backing these four specific classifications. Research shows that people learn best through multiple approaches, which is why this course includes both a [Readings](/readings/) and [Trainings](/trainings/) section. At one point, I provided several papers to support this, but many of those sources are also referenced in this excellent video:

</center>

### *What if I find a mistake?*
Tell me! I strive to be error free but unfortunately like everyone else, make silly mistakes including grammar and spelling errors as well! 

## Course materials
There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.

There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.  

## Software
### R and RStudio

To conduct quantitative analyses, you will be introduced to the open source (and free!) statistical programming language [`r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`](https://cran.r-project.org/) as soon as the term begins. We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) s the main program to work with the R language. Think of R as the engine and RStudio as the dashboard — R handles all the computations, while RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the code and results. *You do not need to have any programming experience to use R!*

You can [find instructions for installing R and RStudio here](/resource/install/).

## Help

Data science and statistical programming can be challenging. Computers are stupid, and even the tiniest coding errors can lead to major headaches. Anyone working with syntax-based software at any level experiences this!

Thankfully, there are plenty of resources available both online and locally. Before our first session, please take a moment to go through this slideshow for a quick overview of the main outlets.

## Assignments and Grades

You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/).

```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points,  ~Assignment,
  100, "In Class Tasks",
  200, "Out of Class Tasks",
  200, "Data Camp Assessments",
  200, "R Project",
  100, "R Presentation",
  200, "Shiny Project",
  100, "Shiny Presentation",
  400, "Final Project Narrative",
  100, "Final Project Presentation",
  100, "Course Survey",
  300, "Extra Tasks"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points),
         Percent = scales::percent(Percent, accuracy = 1))

grading <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Range,
  "A",  "90–100%",
  "B",  "80%-89%",  
  "C",  "70–79%",
  "D",  "60–69%", 
  "F",  "< 60%"
)
```


<div class="centered-table">

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                            Points = sum(assignments$Points),
                            Percent = NA)

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% 
  select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "lcc", missing = "—")
```
</div>

<br />
<div class="centered-table">

```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
grading %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "lc", 
               col.names = c("Grade", "Range"))
```

<div>

### Office Hours

These are set times dedicated to you the student. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of office hours, please watch the following video

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen id="officehours" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;"></iframe>

On that note, I am happy to meet face-to-face or via Zoom.

## Conduct and Expectations

Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:

- **Late work**: Barring the in-class only tasks (if applicable), past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final calculated grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via <a href='https://ecampus.wvu.edu/' target='_blank'>eCampus</a> and are not accepted by any other means (e.g. email, paper, singing telegram). <span style="color:#20c499; font-weight: bold">There are no exceptions to this overarching policy</span>.
- **Participation**: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and asking/answering questions - great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.
- **Justifications**: On any submission or posting, you must justify any assertion. I don't know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you've probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that *the core of the Earth is made of glitter*, the first question you should be asking is *what's your evidence?*.
- **Rubrics**: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br>
  1. When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn't typically provided.
  2. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). 
  3. Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. 
  4. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br>
- **Technology use**: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We're all adults^[...most of the time.].

- **Assumptions**:<br>
  1. All submissions are to be written **formally** and should include with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. 
  2. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism. However if you care about data, real-world practice, and learning a highly marketable skill then you've come to the right place.
  3. This course covers a lot of material, and it is normal to encounter challenges along the way. While there is value in the satisfaction of solving things on your own, it does not mean you have to do it entirely by yourself. Sometimes, a little guidance can bring about the same sense of accomplishment, so do not hesitate to reach out for help. 


## Course policies

<div class="text-center">
**Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don't cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.**
</div>

We will also follow [WVU's Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/campus-student-code){target="_blank"}.

This syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that **I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus** and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.

## COVID-19 Statement

WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.

In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.

If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes. 

### Psychological and Psychiatric Services

Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Psychological and Psychiatric Services](https://carruth.wvu.edu/home){target="_blank"} provides free, *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.

### CARE Team

If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed [here](https://careteam.wvu.edu/referrals){target="_blank"}, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main [WVU CARE TEAM](https://careteam.wvu.edu/home){target="_blank"} site.

### Lauren's Promise

<div class="text-center">
**I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.**
</div>

Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, [was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/24/us/lauren-mccluskey-university-of-utah-fatal-shooting/index.html){target="_blank"}. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.

If you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at [304-293-3136](callto: 304-293-3136).

If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private [Title IX On-Call Line](https://diversity.wvu.edu/equity-assurance/resources-and-reporting-options){target="_blank"} [304-906-9930](callto: 304-906-9930).

Any form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at [http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext](http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext){target="_blank"}. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter. 

### Inclusivity Statement

The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.

If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services ([304-293-6700](callto: 304-293-3136)).  

For more information on West Virginia University's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see [http://diversity.wvu.edu](http://diversity.wvu.edu){target="_blank"}.

### Incomplete Grades

Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.  The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.

### Sale of Course Materials

All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/){target="_blank"}. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. **Basically you can share what you like but don't try to make a buck.**

### Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) 

Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.

### University Attendance Policy

At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students' grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success. 

### Postings

Please follow these simple netiquette rules:

-	Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE.
-	Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. 
-	Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. 
-	Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.
-	Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. 
-	Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. 
-	Never give your password to another person. 
-	Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. 
-	Never spam your classmates. 
-	If you quote someone's previous post, only quote enough to make your point.

Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy [http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext](http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext){target="_blank"}.
