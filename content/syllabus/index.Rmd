## Many Mixed-Methods Studies Lack the Mixing Component

Mixed-method studies emerged from the ongoing divide between proponents of qualitative and quantitative approaches. For many, combining these two distinct perspectives has opened new possibilities, offering flexibility in research design that can be sequential, concurrent, or even a blend of both. Additionally, when one method shows weaknesses, its complement can provide valuable support through the mixing process. Given these advantages, *why aren’t more studies mixed-methods?* Good question. There are two main reasons:

- Misunderstanding or misidentification: Researchers may incorrectly label their study as mixed-methods without fully engaging in the integration process, resulting in a multi-methods study instead.
- Methodological or structural challenges: Mixed-method studies carry greater risk, as errors in one approach can affect the other, potentially jeopardizing the entire study.

## Course objectives

The overall purpose of this course is to empower you to

- <span style="color:#ffffff">assess various types of triangulation</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">create aesthetically pleasing and informative single and mixed method(s) data visualizations</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">design a structurally sound mixed methods study</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">determine how to assess item reliability and validity</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">identify pigeonholed designs and steps needed to avoid them</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">implement both quantitative and qualitative approaches when assessing open bodies of text</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">recognize standard mixed models and to create custom variants</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">utilize frequentist and/or basic Bayesian statistical methods to address effects or impacts</span>

Additionally, this class will expose you to [`r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`](https://cran.r-project.org/) — one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundational skill set, you'll know enough to be able to conduct basic and some advanced analyses, create eye-popping data visualizations, and report results.

## Quick Start Guide

Please note that the slideshow goes through highlights of the syllabus, but you are still responsible for reading through the entire site including this page.

## FAQ

### *Is the course content difficult?*
You've probably heard an answer like this before: *At times some of the material can be dense.* Well that isn't much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.

### *Is R difficult?*
Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it's akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated...and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!

### *What if I'm a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner...*
You're not one of those or even any of those. There's not one accepted study that supports one type of learning style over another. In fact, there aren't even any studies that support these four classifications either. You learn the best using multiple approaches. At one time I denoted multiple papers to support this, but recently a fantastic video was released and many of the sources I listed were also cited so enjoy this instead:

### *What if I find a mistake?*
Tell me! I strive to be error free but unfortunately like everyone else, make silly mistakes including grammar and spelling errors as well! 

### *What do the different pages on the site mean?*

These are given in the order you see them in top of the site.

Occasionally, there will be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these resources will be provided on the content page for that session.

### Softwares

Quantitative and qualitative software is often expensive, proprietary, and limit you to their specific environment. In this course you'll be exposed to open-source software packages and platforms.

#### Taguette

To conduct quantitative analyses, you will be introduced to the open-source (and free!) software [Taguette](https://www.taguette.org/) later in the term. Please go to the site as soon as possible to download and install the desktop version. 

#### R and RStudio

To conduct quantitative analyses, you will be introduced to the open source (and free!) statistical programming language [`r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`](https://cran.r-project.org/) as soon as the term begins. We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) s the main program to work with the R language. Think of R as the engine and RStudio as the dashboard — R handles all the computations, while RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the code and results. 
*You do not need to have any programming experience to use R!*

You can [find instructions for installing R and RStudio here](/resource/install/).

### Help

Data science and statistical programming can be challenging. Computers are stupid, and even the tiniest coding errors can lead to major headaches. Anyone working with syntax-based software at any level experiences this!

Thankfully, there are plenty of resources available both online and locally. Before our first session, please take a moment to go through this slideshow for a quick overview of the main outlets.

### Office Hours
T
hese are set times dedicated to you the student. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of office hours, please watch the following video

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen id="officehours" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;"></iframe>

On that note, I am happy to meet face-to-face or via Zoom.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, we can only meet via Zoom. This can be scheduled using the [calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short15) app. 

## Conduct and Expectations

Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:

- **Late work**: Barring the in-class only tasks, past due deliverable will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via [eCampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu/). There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that coursework *will not* be accepted by email or any other means.
- **Participation**: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and answering questions - great; if it means sitting quietly and being focused - also great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.
- **Justifications**: On any submission, you must justify any assertion. I don't know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you've probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that *the core of the Earth is made of pixy sticks*, the first question you should be asking is *what's your evidence?*.
- **Rubrics**: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br>
  1. When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn't often provided.
  2. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). 
  3. Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. 
  4. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br>
- **Technology use**: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We're all adults^[...most of the time.].

- **Assumptions**:<br>
  1. All submissions are to be written **formally** and should include with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. 
  2. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism. However if you care about data, real-world practice, and learning a highly marketable skill then you've come to the right place.
  3. This course covers a lot of material, and it is normal to encounter challenges along the way. While there is value in the satisfaction of solving things on your own, it does not mean you have to do it entirely by yourself. Sometimes, a little guidance can bring about the same sense of accomplishment, so do not hesitate to reach out for help. 

## Course Policies

**In a nutshell** ***keep an open line of communication***, **be** ***honest***, ***nice***, ***respectful*** **to everyone**, **&** *follow the* <a href='https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/campus-student-code' target='_blank'>Code of Conduct</a>.

### Modifications

This syllabus outlines a plan for the term, but adjustments may become necessary as circumstances change. Therefore, **I reserve the right to modify this syllabus** as we progress through the course.

### Health statement

WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to health crisis, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.

In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe guidelines set by the University at all times. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.

If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes. 

### Psychological and Psychiatric Services

Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Psychological and Psychiatric Services](https://carruth.wvu.edu/home) provides free, *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.

### CARE Team

If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed [here](https://careteam.wvu.edu/referrals), please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main [WVU CARE TEAM](https://careteam.wvu.edu/home) site.

### Lauren's Promise

<div class="text-center">
**I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.**
</div>

Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, [was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/24/us/lauren-mccluskey-university-of-utah-fatal-shooting/index.html).

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at [http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext](http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext). Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter. 

### Inclusivity Statement

The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.

### Incomplete Grades

Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.  The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

### Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) 

Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.

### University Attendance Policy

At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students' grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. 

### Course Netiquette

The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Please follow these simple netiquette rules:

- Act as professionally in your writing as you would in a face-to-face classroom.
- Avoid typing in ALL CAPS, as it comes across as SHOUTING.
- Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not the entire class.
- Disagree with ideas, but avoid comments that could be seen as personal attacks.
- Do not dominate any discussion; allow other students the chance to participate.
- If you reference someone’s post, quote only what is necessary to make your point.
- Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space.
- Never give your password to another person.
- Never spam your classmates.
- Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks.

### Response Time
I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.
