## Survey Says Most People Are Terrible At Creating Surveys

We live in a data-driven world, and surveys provide a significant portion of that information. Online platforms have made it so easy for anyone to create and distribute surveys that many of us find multiple examples landing in our inboxes each week. Given their widespread use, you might think there would be an overwhelming amount of data, but the average response rate typically falls between 20% and 30%. So, what is the issue? While some factors are beyond a survey designer’s control, elements such as creating an aesthetically pleasing instrument, understanding various analyses, showcasing skills in data visualization, building valid and reliable designs, setting measurable outcomes, and incorporating pilot testing can all impact a survey’s feasibility and success.

## Course objectives

The overall purpose of this course is to empower you to

-  <span style="color:#ffffff">administer both flat traditional and modern interactive surveys via the Internet</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">assess missingness and determine next steps</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">create aesthetically pleasing surveys using color theory and design techniques</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">determine how to assess item reliability and validity</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">enhance the look and feel of surveys using sandboxed syntax</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">implement text mining approaches to probabilistically determine respondent sentiments and detect topics</span>

- <span style="color:#ffffff">utilize frequentist and/or basic Bayesian statistical methods to determine outcomes</span>

Additionally, this class will expose you to [`r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`](https://cran.r-project.org/)&nbsp; — one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundational skill set, you'll know enough to be able to conduct basic and some advanced analyses, create eye-popping data visualizations, and report results.

## FAQ

### *Is the course content difficult?*
You have likely heard a response like this before:  *...at times some of the material can be hard...* While vague, difficulty is subjective, varies, and will depend on your academic and practical background. Instead, focus on this question:

<center>
<p id="rounded_corners">
Can I search for help independently first and then reach out if needed?
</p>
</center>

If your answer is yes, then you are likely well-positioned to succeed in this class. Make sure to go through the <a href="#rstats"><span style="color:#03dac6"><b>How to Ask for Help with R and RStudio</b></span></a>.

### *Is R difficult?*
Learning `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` can be especially challenging at first—it’s like learning a new language, whether it’s Spanish or even math. Even experienced R users get frustrated—some of us even have swear jars! However, as silly as it sounds, one of the best feelings is overcoming a logical roadblock. So, if you find yourself getting irritated, try this: take a break, step away for a bit, sleep on it, and/or discuss it with a peer. If you are reaching your limit, take a few deep breaths and reach out to me!

### *What if I'm a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner?*
You do not fall into any one of those categories. In fact, there is no widely accepted study that supports a single learning style over another, nor is there solid evidence backing these four specific classifications. Research shows that people learn best through multiple approaches, which is why this course includes both a [Readings](/readings/) and [Trainings](/trainings/) section. At one point, I provided several papers to support this, but many of those sources are also referenced in this excellent video:

</center>

### *What if I find a mistake?*
Tell me! I strive to be error free but unfortunately like everyone else, make silly mistakes including grammar and spelling errors as well! 

### *What do the different pages on the site mean?*

Information about these is provided in the same order as they appear at the top of the site.

Occasionally, there will be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these resources will be provided on the content page for that session.


## Software

### Quatrics

You will need access to your WVU <a href='https://wvu.qualtrics.com/' target='_blank'>Qualtrics</a> account. Please go to the site and check if you can login. If not, please submit a <a href='https://wvu.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals' target='_blank'>ticket to IT</a> or give them a ring at [304-293-4444](callto:%20304-293-4444).

### R and RStudio

To conduct quantitative analyses, you will be introduced to the open source (and free!) statistical programming language [`r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`](https://cran.r-project.org/) as soon as the term begins. We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) s the main program to work with the R language. Think of R as the engine and RStudio as the dashboard — R handles all the computations, while RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the code and results. *You do not need to have any programming experience to use R!*

You can [find instructions for installing R and RStudio here](/resource/install/).

## Help

Data science and statistical programming can be challenging. Computers are stupid, and even the tiniest coding errors can lead to major headaches. Anyone working with syntax-based software at any level experiences this!

Thankfully, there are plenty of resources available both online and locally. Before our first session, please take a moment to go through this slideshow for a quick overview of the main outlets.

## Communication

### Slack

We have a class <a href='https://edp619fall2022.slack.com' target='_blank'>Slack</a> channel where you can pose questions and post as needed. This is the only platform where I have class notifications enabled on my devices, so please make use of it.

### Email

Rather than including a list of things that are appropriate when writing an email, this strip from <a href='https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_list.php' target='_blank'>PhD Comics</a> will do

<center>
<img src='/img/comics/email-instructions.png' alt='Email Instructions'>
</center>

### Zoom

One-on-one video conferences can be created via the class <a href='https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short15' target='_blank'>calendar</a> in 15 minute increments. If you require more than 15 minutes, please schedule additional back-to-back sessions.

### Office Hours

These are set times dedicated to you the student. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of office hours, please watch the following video

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen id="officehours" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;"></iframe>

On that note, I am happy to meet face-to-face or via Zoom.

## Conduct and Expectations

Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:

- **Late work**: Barring the in-class only tasks (if applicable), past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final calculated grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via <a href='https://ecampus.wvu.edu/' target='_blank'>eCampus</a> and are not accepted by any other means (e.g. email, paper, singing telegram). <span style="color:#20c499; font-weight: bold">There are no exceptions to this overarching policy</span>.
- **Participation**: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and asking/answering questions - great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.
- **Justifications**: On any submission or posting, you must justify any assertion. I don't know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you've probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that *the core of the Earth is made of glitter*, the first question you should be asking is *what's your evidence?*.
- **Rubrics**: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br>
  1. When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn't typically provided.
  2. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). 
  3. Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. 
  4. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br>
- **Technology use**: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We're all adults^[...most of the time.].

- **Assumptions**:<br>
  1. All submissions are to be written **formally** and should include with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. 
  2. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism. However if you care about data, real-world practice, and learning a highly marketable skill then you've come to the right place.
  3. This course covers a lot of material, and it is normal to encounter challenges along the way. While there is value in the satisfaction of solving things on your own, it does not mean you have to do it entirely by yourself. Sometimes, a little guidance can bring about the same sense of accomplishment, so do not hesitate to reach out for help. 

## Course Policies

**In a nutshell** ***keep an open line of communication***, **be** ***honest***, ***nice***, ***respectful*** **to everyone**, **&** *follow the* <a href='https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/campus-student-code' target='_blank'>Code of Conduct</a>.

### Modifications

This syllabus outlines a plan for the term, but adjustments may become necessary as circumstances change. Therefore, **I reserve the right to modify this syllabus** as we progress through the course.

### Health statement

WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to health crisis, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.

In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe guidelines set by the University at all times. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.

If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the <a href='http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext' target='_blank'>West Virginia University Academic Catalog</a>. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.

### Incomplete Grades

Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.  The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office.

### Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) 

Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.

### University Attendance Policy

At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students' grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success. 

### Postings

Please follow these simple netiquette rules:

-	Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE.
-	Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. 
-	Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. 
-	Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.
