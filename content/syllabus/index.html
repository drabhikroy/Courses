<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div id="is-the-course-content-difficult" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Is the course content difficult?</em></h3>
<p>You have likely heard a response like this before: <em>…at times some of the material can be hard…</em> While vague, difficulty is subjective, varies, and will depend on your academic and practical background. Instead, focus on this question:</p>
<center>
<p id="rounded_corners">
Can I search for help independently first and then reach out if needed?
</p>
</center>
<p>If your answer is yes, then you are likely well-positioned to succeed in this class. Make sure to go through the <a href="#rstats"><span style="color:#03dac6"><b>How to Ask for Help with R and RStudio</b></span></a>.</p>

Even experienced R users get frustrated—some of us even have swear jars! However, as silly as it sounds, one of the best feelings is overcoming a logical roadblock. So, if you find yourself getting irritated, try this: take a break, step away for a bit, sleep on it, and/or discuss it with a peer. If you are reaching your limit, take a few deep breaths and reach out to me!</p>

<div id="what-if-im-a-visualauralread-writekinesthetic-learner" class="section level3">
<h3><em>What if I’m a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner?</em></h3>
<p>You do not fall into any one of those categories. In fact, there is no widely accepted study that supports a single learning style over another, nor is there solid evidence backing these four specific classifications. Research shows that people learn best through multiple approaches, which is why this course includes both a <a href="/readings/">Readings</a> and <a href="/trainings/">Trainings</a> section. At one point, I provided several papers to support this, but many of those sources are also referenced in this excellent video:</p>

We will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> s the main program to work with the R language.

<h2>Help</h2>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be challenging. Computers are stupid, and even the tiniest coding errors can lead to major headaches. Anyone working with syntax-based software at any level experiences this!</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>

</div>
<div id="conduct-and-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Conduct and Expectations</h2>
<p>Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Late work</strong>: Barring the in-class only tasks (if applicable), past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final calculated grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via <a href='https://ecampus.wvu.edu/' target='_blank'>eCampus</a> and are not accepted by any other means (e.g. email, paper, singing telegram). <span style="color:#20c499; font-weight: bold">There are no exceptions to this overarching policy</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong>: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and asking/answering questions - great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justifications</strong>: On any submission or posting, you must justify any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that <em>the core of the Earth is made of glitter</em>, the first question you should be asking is <em>what’s your evidence?</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubrics</strong>: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t typically provided.</li>
<li>If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up).</li>
<li>Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor.</li>
<li>Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology use</strong>: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions</strong>:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All submissions are to be written <strong>formally</strong> and should include with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable.</li>
<li>People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism. However if you care about data, real-world practice, and learning a highly marketable skill then you’ve come to the right place.</li>
<li>This course covers a lot of material, and it is normal to encounter challenges along the way. While there is value in the satisfaction of solving things on your own, it does not mean you have to do it entirely by yourself. Sometimes, a little guidance can bring about the same sense of accomplishment, so do not hesitate to reach out for help.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-policies" class="section level2">
<h2>Course policies</h2>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We will also follow <a href="https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/campus-student-code" target="_blank">WVU’s Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>This syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that <strong>I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus</strong> and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.</p>
</div>
<div id="covid-19-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>COVID-19 Statement</h2>
<p>WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.</p>
<p>In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.</p>
<p>If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.</p>
<div id="psychological-and-psychiatric-services" class="section level3">
<h3>Psychological and Psychiatric Services</h3>
