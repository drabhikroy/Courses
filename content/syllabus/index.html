<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>You can measure many things</strong> Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. Even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized.</p>
<p>When assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.</p>
<p>Specifically, you should be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices</li>
<li>confidently determining valid and reliable measures</li>
<li>interpret and report psychometric properties of tests</li>
<li>recognize measurement in the evaluative process</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of this course, you will hopefully become (1) literate in the connection between data and measurement principles, and (2) a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across.</p>
<p>Additionally, this class will expose you to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"><svg aria-hidden="true" role="img" viewBox="0 0 581 512" style="height:1em;width:1.13em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:steelblue;overflow:visible;position:relative;"><path d="M581 226.6C581 119.1 450.9 32 290.5 32S0 119.1 0 226.6C0 322.4 103.3 402 239.4 418.1V480h99.1v-61.5c24.3-2.7 47.6-7.4 69.4-13.9L448 480h112l-67.4-113.7c54.5-35.4 88.4-84.9 88.4-139.7zm-466.8 14.5c0-73.5 98.9-133 220.8-133s211.9 40.7 211.9 133c0 50.1-26.5 85-70.3 106.4-2.4-1.6-4.7-2.9-6.4-3.7-10.2-5.2-27.8-10.5-27.8-10.5s86.6-6.4 86.6-92.7-90.6-87.9-90.6-87.9h-199V361c-74.1-21.5-125.2-67.1-125.2-119.9zm225.1 38.3v-55.6c57.8 0 87.8-6.8 87.8 27.3 0 36.5-38.2 28.3-87.8 28.3zm-.9 72.5H365c10.8 0 18.9 11.7 24 19.2-16.1 1.9-33 2.8-50.6 2.9v-22.1z"/></svg></a> — one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages.

<h3><em>Is the course content difficult?</em></h3>
<p>You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: <em>At times some of the material can be dense.</em> Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.</p>

Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!</p>

<h3><em>What if I’m a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner?</em></h3>
<p>You’re not one or even any of those. There’s not one accepted study that supports one type of learning style over another. In fact, there aren’t even any studies that support these four classifications either. You learn the best using multiple approaches which is why there is both a <a href="/readings/">Readings</a> and <a href="/extras/">Extras</a> section. At one time I denoted multiple papers to support this, but many of the sources I listed were also cited in this fantastic video:</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Please watch this video:</p>

<p>Office hours are set times dedicated to you the student!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). This means that I will be in my office or at home waiting for you to <del>come by</del> talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, we can only meet via Zoom. This can be scheduled using the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short15">calendar</a> app.</p>

<div id="conduct-and-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Conduct and Expectations</h2>
<p>Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Late work</strong>: Barring the in-class only tasks, past due deliverable will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via <a href="https://ecampus.wvu.edu/">eCampus</a>. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that coursework <em>will not</em> be accepted by email or any other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong>: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and answering questions - great; if it means sitting quietly and being focused - also great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justifications</strong>: On any submission, you must justify any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that <em>the core of the Earth is made of pixy sticks</em>, the first question you should be asking is <em>what’s your evidence?</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubrics</strong>: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided.</li>
<li>If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up).</li>
<li>Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor.</li>
<li>Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology use</strong>: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions</strong>:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Just assume that all submissions are to be written <strong>formally</strong> and should include with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable.</li>
<li>People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place.</li>
<li>There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<div id="learning-and-knowledge-during-a-pandemic" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning and knowledge during a pandemic</h3>
<p>When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have <em>learned</em>. However learning is not the same as knowledge .
To save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, an indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:</p>
<center>
<p id="rounded_corners">
Can I describe <i>whatever</i> using language so that a child could understand it?

<h3>COVID-19 statement</h3>
<p>WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.</p>
<p>In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.</p>
<p>If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.</p>

<h3>Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI)</h3>
<p>Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued.

<div id="university-attendance-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>University Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Netiquette</h3>
<p>The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate.</li>
<li>Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name.</li>
<li>Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE.</li>
<li>Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom.</li>
<li>Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks.</li>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.</li>
<li>Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack.</li>
<li>Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class.</li>
<li>Never give your password to another person.</li>
<li>Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space.</li>
<li>Never spam your classmates.</li>
<li>If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy <a href="http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext">http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext</a>.

</div>
<div id="response-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Response Time</h3>
<p>I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.</p>
