```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
# LIST YOUR LIBRARIES HERE (if applicable)
```

## Proposal
WRITE AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD. 

- Code chunks are welcome, but not necessary! 

- Please make sure to knit any code chunk with `echo=FALSE` and any other options that suporess anything but the intended output.
