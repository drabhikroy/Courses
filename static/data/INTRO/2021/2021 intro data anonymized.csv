Coming from a background of no research in college, the educational sessions gave me a much better idea of how the world of research works.

I also cannot praise my mentor, Dr. Dietz, enough.  He worked with me every step of the way throughout my project.  He set realistic goals for the amount of time and my level of training.  Going into the INTRO program, I saw research as a box that I had to tick for residency.  After working Dr. Dietz I am very excited about continuing to hone my skills and continue to work in some aspect of research throughout the rest of my training.",Yes,,"The INTRO program was perfect for a student without research such as myself.

14,,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,I did not attend this session, Good,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Yes,"I think the biggest thing is to continue to stretch your comfort zone and engage the research faculty at WVU. You're now a graduate student and these individuals are too busy to target students for research opportunities. However, they are extremely friendly and can always use help on projects, so continue to reach out to PI's with who you are, why you think you could help in their projects, and asking them to be involved in their research. ", Good,"I think that I got really valuable new bench research experience. I ran projects and engaged in techniques I had no previous experience with and really grew as a researcher. However, I feel like there were some shortcomings in my research. I would have liked more opportunities to improve my writing and presentation skills and I feel like I did not get opportunities to do this. I also wish I would have some more personalized mentorship from my PI but my interactions with them were limited. ",Yes,"I think that the weekly presentations and seminars were awesome. There I could hear from others about their research throughout the summer and engage faculty researchers at WVU who were presenting. It was also nice getting lunch afterwards to spend some time with other students and ask more detailed questions about their research. I would like to see a pre-program get together before we start our research to build relationships before walking in for our first lecture. However, I really enjoyed the weekly structured engagement. ",I feel like it was getting closer with other individuals in my lab. It was a great networking opportunity and I got to learn how to work in a team environment in the research lab. ,Unsure,,,,,,Passive,8,"I think having more clear avenues to interacting with the PIs signed up for the program would be helpful. It is somewhat impersonal to just provide a list of researchers and allowing students to reach out to individuals by themselves. As medical students, it is extremely difficult to schedule multiple meetings to explore different researchers and their projects during the spring curriculum. It would be nice to almost have a research fair where the PIs can come and present their research to students interested allowing us to have a one-time opportunity to see the PI's personalities and projects of interest. ",I think allowing them to have more interactions with the WVU students would be good to make them more comfortable with the group as a whole. ,More in-person advertisement of the research projects before the program,Standardized interviews with PI's applying to the program to make sure they are the right fit for students to learn under. ,More opportunities for hands on experiences to build our research writing skills. ,More opportunities for social events between the different student researchers. ,,,,,,,MS 2,,Thank you all for the opportunity to help me build my research skills and experiences. It was a very influential summer and I appreciate all the time you guys put into the summer to make our experiences enriching.
