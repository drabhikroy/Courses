#  Plan for the Day 

--

+ Ethics Wrap Up

--

+ Review remaining Ethics Slides

--

+ Facebook Article Discussion

--

+ Literature Matrix Group Discussion

--

+ Getting Started in Research

--

+ Preliminary Ideas Roundtable

---
#  Re: Ethics 



---
#  Facebook Article 



---
#  Literature Matrix Group Discussion 

+ In Groups, review your literature matrix.

--

+ Compare/Contrast notes on articles

--

+ Differences in organization?

--

+ Use for your own Lit Review

---

#  Getting started designing a research project 


---

#  Your own Ideas

--

+ Take a few minutes and consider your own ideas for a research study as we go through the next set of slides:

--

	+ Select a topic to study (maybe what you’re going to do your lit review on)
	
--

	+ Which broad approach do you plan to use (Qualitative, Quantitative)
	
--

	+ Research Purpose Statement

--

	+ 2-3 Research Questions or Hypotheses
	
--

	+ Indented Measures
	
--

	+ Sampling Method

--

+ Prepare to share your initial ideas at the end of class!

#  Selecting a Research Topic 

Where to get ideas?

--

+ Literature
+ Personal interests
+ Observations
+ Previous research experience

--

+ Narrow your topic
  + Undergraduate research
  + Mentor-Mentee Relationships in UR
  + Disciplinary knowledge transfer between mentors and mentees in UR
	
--

+ Additional Considerations:
  + Researchable?
	+ Significance, Value, Worth?
	+ Has it been done before?

---

#  Lit Review 

+ Goal is to both review research in topic area AND to make it clear why your research questions can add to the field.
--

+ Include seminal studies (landmark studies)

--

+ Synthesize existing literature, do not summarize!

#  Research Purpose, Questions, and Hypotheses  

Research Purpose Statement
+ Purpose and objectives of the study.

--

  + May vary based on approach used (Qual verses Quant)
  
--

Hypotheses & Research Questions

--

+ Hypothesis: predictive relationships between variables (quant)

--

	+ Research Questions: guiding questions of the study
	
--

		+ Quant research – can have both hypotheses and RQs but not always
		
--

		+ Qual – Research questions may be more inductive or open ended.

---
#  Measurement & Variables  

--

+ Categorical Variables
	+ Variables that are able to be sorted into meaningful groups
	+ Student year in school, Race, Binaries (Yes, No; enrolled, not enrolled)
		
--

+ Continuous Variables
  + Rely on progress and preserve meaningful distance between variables
	+ Age, Income, time spent in condition

--

+ Independent Variables
	+ Influences or impacts other variables
		
--

+ Dependent Variable
	+ Affected or influenced by other variables
	+ “depends” on other variables
		
---

# Also...

--

+ Extraneous Variables
	+ May impact data and aren’t controlled for in the study
	+ Covariates

--

	+ May impact the study, so you control for these in your study!

---

#  Sampling 

+ Things to consider:
	+ Who is your population?
	+ Who is the broad group you are interested in that you’re pulling your sample from?
	
--

+ Population: Undergraduate mentors and mentees at R1 institutions.

--

+ Sample: 10 mentor-mentee pairs at R1 university on the mid-East coast.
  + Consider how many participants you might need:
  + Sample size calculators (quantitative research)
  + Reaching saturation (qualitative research)
[calculators](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm)

---
#  Sampling 

--

- *Probability Sampling*: Participant selection based on strategy such that population has a known and nonzero chance of being selected. Typically used in quant research. Useful if you are hoping to generalize your findings.

--

- *Purposeful Sampling*: Selecting participants who are the best candidates for the study. Typically used in qualitative research!

# Your own Ideas

--

+ Take a few minutes and consider your own ideas for a research study:
	
--

	+ Select a topic to study (maybe what you’re going to do your lit review on)
	
--

	+ Which broad approach do you plan to use (Qualitative, Quantitative)
	
--

	+ Research Purpose Statement
	
--

	+ 2-3 Research Questions or Hypotheses
	
--

	+ Indented Measures & Variables
	
--

	+ Sampling Method

---
#  Roundtable 

+ Talk us through your ideas so far!

--

	+ Study purpose, Hypotheses/Research Questions,  Approach (qual or quant), Variables and measures of interest, Sampling

--

	+ Ask each other (and us) questions!

---
#  For Next Week: 

+ Topic: Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs

--

	+ Due: L1 - Selecting a Topic and Annotated Bib 
		+ (Similar to what we did in class today!)
		+ Select a topic and describe it in 500 (+/- 50) words
		+ Include an Appendix of the Annotated Bibliography
			+ 5 articles in bibliography
		+ Follow formatting guidelines (APA 7)
		
--

	+ Read:
		+ Leavy Chapter 4, p. 87-93.
		+ Shadish , Cook, & Campbell, Chapter 1
