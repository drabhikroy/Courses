#  What are ethics?
		
--

.center2[
&lt;b&gt;The set of values, standards, and principles used to determine appropriate and acceptable conduct at all stages of the research process&lt;/b&gt;
]

---



#  What do ethics not “care about”?

--

+ Being ﬁrst to a discovery
		
--

+ Good or bad people
		
--

+ Keeping pace with peers
		
--

+ Maintaining [publish or perish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish)

--

+ Professional pressures
		
--

+ Securing grants
		
--

+ Getting or keeping [Tenure](https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/retaining a job


.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; As opposed to political rhetoric, this absolutely does NOT imply faculty are immune from being fired.
]


---



#  Ethics are imperfect 

+ Accident
		
--

+ Missing something, especially with new methods or  technology
		
--

+ One can become involved  in research  ethics  violations  + through  the wrongs  of others
		
--

+ Socially acceptable practice later deem wrong
		
--

+ Sometimes the right thing to do just isn’t clear
		
--

+ Self-deception and other psychological tendencies
		
--

+ Taking shortcuts

---

#  The Easier Cases (to identify) 

---



# Example: [Human Radiation Experiments](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/human-radiation-experiments)

--

+ Commissioned by the United States Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission

--

  + feeding radioactive material to mentally disabled children
  
--

  + conducting research on the effects of radiation on human subjects, including medical research on using radioisotopes to diagnose or cure disease
  
--

  + injections of plutonium given to semi-comatose cancer patients to determine how much uranium was needed to produce kidney damage

--

  + irradiating the testicles of prisoners
  
--

  + exposing U.S. soldiers to high levels of radiation without informing them
  
--

+ Many more examples exist!

---



# Example: [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm)
		
--

  + Conducted by the United States Public Health Service - now the CDC - to study the effect of untreated syphilis to determine the natural history of the disease
  
--

  +  **Began in 1932** with **399 poor African American men** with *late-stage syphilis*. 
  
--

  + **Ended in 1972** with a total of **600 poor African American men**.
  
--

  + *Participants*  were offered "free medical care" in exchange for their medical data.
  
--

  + More than 400 individuals were not 
 
--

    + told that they had syphilis *OR*
    + offered the standard treatment for syphilis *OR*
    + provided penicillin when it became available as a cure!
    
--

  + [At least 28 of the men died](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/12/archives/at-least-28-died-in-syphilis-study-reports-on-tuskegee-tests.html) of the disease and some unknowingly transmitted the disease to their wives and children.

# Example: [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://www.prisonexp.org/) (SPE)
		
--

+ Initiated to study roles of prisoners and guards

--

+ Students cast as prisoners and guards were curated from 70 applicants
  
--

+ Those with psychological problems, disabilities, prior records and a history of drug use were excluded leaving a sample of 24 individuals
  
--

+ A coin toss decided who who be a guard or prisoner
  
--

+ Initially a two-week experiment but lasted only six days
  
--

+ “Actors” blindly assumed and identified with their roles and brutality commences beginning Day 2.

#  Interpretations and Results Stemming from the SPE
		
--

+ *Bystander Effect*: Individuals are less like to help a victim when others are present.

--

  + *Cognitive dissonance*: Conflicting attitudes, behaviors, and/or beliefs produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration of one, if not all of the of the three items listed above to restore comfort.
  
--

  + *Conformity*: Changes in attitudes, behaviors, and/or beliefs in order to satisfy group norms and to fit in.
  
--

  + *Interpretation*: Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being.
	
--

+ *Note*: Outcomes are [ disputed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/psychology-studies-stanford-prison.html)

# [Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html)

--
 
+ Summarizes ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects.

--

	+ Specifies three principles for conducting research in humans:

--

		+ Respect for persons

--

		+ Beneficence

--

		+ Justice
		
--

	+ Further information can be found at the [Health and Human Services website](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html)

# [Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/)

--
 
+ A set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation developed for the medical community by the World Medical Association (WMA).

--
 
	+ Regarded as the seminal narrative on human research ethics.

--

	+ Not legally binding.

--

	+ Encompasses 37 principles over 11 dimensions of ethics and human subjects research.

+ Available via the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full) 

---



#  Summary 

--

+ Over a one-week period in 2012, researchers manipulated the news feeds for a random sample of close to 700,000 Facebook users.

--

	+ News Feed is the constantly updating list of content from your friends that is shown on the middle of your Facebook page.

--

	+ Because there are typically more stories than can be displayed, Facebook uses an algorithm that tries to show the stories a user would find most engaging or relevant.

--

	+ One group had reduced negative content; one reduced positive
	
--

	+ Used the [Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count](https://liwc.wpengine.com/compare-versions/) software (LIWC2007) to determine sentiment of open text content (*sentiment analysis*)
	
--

	+ The hypothesis was that subsequent user posts to Facebook would be affected by what they saw in the News Feed

--

		+ People in the *positivity-reduced* group would have less positive posts
		
--

		+ People in the *negativity-reduced* group would have less negative posts
		
--

+ Results supported the hypothesis that people’s emotions may be affected by what their friends say (*social contagion*)

---



# Controversy

--

+ Facebook users were not asked whether they wanted to participate in this study

--

	+ It was assumed that the [Facebook Data Use Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php) which is required to use the service had informed users that their data might be used for such research purposes

--

	+ The policy read that Facebook used personal data “for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.”

---

#  Activity: Facebook Publication Ethics 

--

+ Get into your groups

--

+ Discuss the following questions with your partner

  + What ethical issues are raised by this study? (prioritize)

  + Could Facebook have addressed the hypothesis without explicitly manipulating the content of the News Feed?

---

#  Possible Ethical Issues 

.pull-left[
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Informed consent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Information&lt;/b&gt; – were participants provided sufficient information?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Comprehension&lt;/b&gt; – did participants fully understand the study and have an opportunity to ask questions?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Voluntariness&lt;/b&gt; – were participants free to decline or withdraw?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vulnerable populations&lt;/b&gt; - did the study include children, prisoners, people with impaired cognitive capacity, etc?
