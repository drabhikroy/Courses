This course is designed to allow you to acquire an understanding of the choices available for and processes involved in conducting mixed methodological research and evaluation. We will work together to identify potential research questions and/or evaluation foci you are interested in and for which mixed methodological approaches could usefully be applied. We will read and discuss both examples of mixed methodological research and writers discussing important issues to think about when doing mixed methods work. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here’s the book we use for EDP 618, and much of what we will discuss today is in there <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right" style="color:#00ecff"></i><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right" style="color:#00ff93"></i>

#  Activating prior knowledge 

<span style="color:#b9bbf4">Pair-Share Activity<span>

--

- Step 1: Find a partner

--

- Step 2: Discuss your current understanding of what Mixed Methods Research entails and why anyone would want to do it.

  *If you finish this before others, also discuss how Mixed Methods Research 	does or does not seem useful for your own interests.*

--

- Step 3: Co-write a single sentence definition of Mixed Methods Research and 	decide which partner will read it to the class.

--

- Step 4: Read aloud and discuss similarities / differences across definitions.

---

#  Differing Standards Across Research Traditions 

--

<span style="color:#b9bbf4">Pair-Share</span>: What do you know about philosophical foundations, especially epistemologies, related to qualitative and quantitative research traditions?

--

<span style="color:#b9bbf4">Whole class</span>: How do you see these fitting together (or not) in mixed methodological research?

#  Triangulation 

> By <b>data source</b> - multiple data collection points

--

> By <b>researcher</b> – multiple researchers

--

> By <b>theory</b> – multiple researchers with different theoretical perspectives

> By <b>method</b> – multiple methods

#  A working definition of MMR 

--


Mixed methodological approaches use paradigms, data sources, and/or analytic procedures from both quantitative and qualitative studies in various combinations.

#  5 Mixed Methods Approaches 

--
  
  **Triangulation** - single phenomenon

--
  
  **Complementarity** - overlapping phenomena

--
  
  **Development** - one method informs the next

--
  
  **Initiation** - seeking paradox / contradiction

--
  
  **Expansion** - study more w/ different methods for different phenomena

#  Sequential Explanatory Example 

--

Way, Stauber, Nakkula, and London (1994) began with quantitative measures of depression and substance use from one suburban and one inner city high schools (*n* = 164 and 242).

--

<br>
<span style="color:#ffde59">
Authors identified a puzzling finding: Substance use predicted depression at the suburban high school, but not at inner city high school.
</span>

--

<br>
Thematic analysis of 19 qualitative interviews (selected based on quantitative CDI data) allowed authors to describe different meanings of substance use across the two schools.

#  Concurrent Triangulation Example 

Idler, Hudson, and Leventhal (1999), working with 159 elderly African Americans, collected quantitative measures (health ratings, demographics, and medical history) and conducted qualitative interviews about the meanings of their ratings .

--

<br>
<span style="color:#ffde59">
They initially analyzed the two data sets separately, but after coding the qualitative responses, they transformed qualitative codes into quantitative scores.

--

<br>
Next, they statistically analyzed the quantified qualitative results to determine if initially qualitative responses were related to quantitative ratings.
