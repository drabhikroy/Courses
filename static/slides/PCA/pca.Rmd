# Welcome! 

There are no audio files included in this slideshow. There are a lot of things going on behind the scenes when using PCAs and this is just a very brief introduction. I have tried to minimize the jargon and complexity, though some items may not be as clear as others. If you have questions, please feel free to reach out!

<!-- 
Some information about the audio files. Firstly and importantly, I'm no Morgan Freeman but each page will have some audio that will hopefully help you understand a bit more about what's on the page

# Correlations

.bg-washed.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Correlations** gives you an idea of the strength or weakness of the relationship between two variables. In a survey where each item is set to measure a single construct, these are essentially the applicable questions
]

--

<center>
correlations are great but...
</center>

--

they don't tell you how every question is related to every other question. This is especially troublesome when you have large data sets!

Enter a method called **Principle Component Analysis**

# Explaining it to Everyone Else 

<center>
.bg-washed.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Evaluation** answers ***if it works?*** and ***why does it work?***
]
</center>
<br>
<br>

--

We typically leave the ***if it works?*** to people with grounded knowledge in a particular area - aka *content experts*.

# Merit, Worth & Significance 

First consider these questions
+ What do ***merit***, ***worth***,and ***significance*** mean to you both separately and combined?

+ Can you think of real world examples of each?

# Evaluation 

+ Evaluation is the act or process of determining the *merit* (***quality***), *worth* (***value***), or *significance* (***importance***) of something or the product of that process.

# Evalu… 

- *Evaluand*. This is not always as obvious to define in practice as it may seem. Where are the boundaries of a particular program? Do the evaluator, their employer, and various other stakeholders agree on those boundaries?

- *Evaluator*. Who you are matters… more on this later

+ In addition to defining these for ourselves, what are examples from everyday?

+ Which of the three is harder to identify? Why?

# Purposes of Evaluation – Secondary 

+ *Developmental* - To help develop an intervention or program

+ *Accountability* - To hold accountable

+ *Monitoring* - To assess implementation and gauge progress toward a desired end

+ *Knowledge Generation* - To generate knowledge about general patterns of effectiveness

+ *Ascriptive* - Merely for the sake of knowing

# Defining Culture 

> What is culture? 

> How do we recognize it?

--

<br>
<i>Culture can be defined as the shared experiences of people, including their languages, values, customs, beliefs, and more. It also includes worldviews, ways of knowing, and ways of communicating. Culturally significant factors encompass, but are not limited to, race/ethnicity, religion, social class, language, disability, sexual orientation, age, and gender.</i><br>

# Cultural Influences Activity 

How might each of the following influence an evaluation’s design and implementation?

 - Language of participants
 - Role of food and eating
 - Evaluators attire when interacting with participants
 - Concept of time
 - Communication styles
 - Importance of family relationships
 - Values/norms re: individualism, independence, conflict
 - Understanding of social structure

# Increasing your cultural sensitivity 

Try to
- Assess your own attitudes, beliefs, values
- Incorporate culturally diverse groups and perspectives throughout evaluation process
- Build in sufficient time to negotiate access and build trust in community / organization
- Demystify evaluation, avoid jargon, build buy-in
- Be flexible in choice of evaluation methods, use multiple data sources, multiple data collection methods, multiple perspectives

# Meta-evaluation

- A ***metaevaluation*** is an evaluation of an evaluation or evaluations.

- There are two main types
  - *Formal* - Extra, external study to authenticate the process or product of the evaluation.

  - *Informal* - Evaluating your own evaluation.

# Logic Model Parts

+ **Inputs**. what resources go into a program (aka investments)

+ **Outputs**. what is produced through those activities
  + **Activities**. what activities the program assumes (what actually occurs)
  + **Participation**. who is part of the program and how are they served (who is served like stakeholders and sponsors and what engagement they have)

+ **Outcomes**. changes or benefits that result from the program
  + **Short**. Learning (awareness, knowledge, attitudes, skills, opinions, aspirations, motivations)
  + **Medium** *or* **Intermediate**. Action (behavior, practice, decisions, policies)
  + **Long**. Consequences (civic, economic, environmental, political, professional, social, etc.)

## Identifying Criteria

+ Any relevant past performance data

+ Costs

+ Existing literature and standards

+ Needs and Goals

## Estimating Cost

+ Often very hard to do well

+ Almost always addressed in a relative way
  
  + Relative resource intensity of alternative programs (including development and/or retraining costs)
  + Proportion of resources allocated to different program activities (logic modeling can be very helpful for thinking about this)

### Develop an Evaluation Purpose Statement

*Step 1*. Critique sample evaluation purpose statements (see following slides) to better understand what might go into crafting a good one.

*Step 2*. Write preliminary evaluation statement for the program you'll evaluate.

*Step 3*. Write 3 - 7 potential evaluation questions relevant to the evaluation purpose statement you wrote for step 2.

## Thinking About Evaluation Statements

In the next two slides, take a look at the sample evaluation purpose statements and *for each* try to identify:

+ What is being evaluated?

+ How will results be used?

+ What kind of evaluation (developmental, formative, or summative)?

+ How could the purpose statement be improved?

# Tips

+ Be clear

+ Be concise 

+ Be truthful

+ Get buy in

+ Be confident but **never** demeaning or overpowering

+ Don’t overpromise and underdeliver!

+ Write in a way that's meaningful to your sponsor(s)/stakeholder(s)

# Final Thoughts? 

What made sense or connected well for you in the things we focus on this week?
What didn’t quite fit together or make sense in your mind?
Anything in the reading you wondered about that we didn’t address?
Any remaining questions about the course, syllabus, assignments, etc.?
