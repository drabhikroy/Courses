Three times this quarter, I've had to completely redo her reports because they were so off the mark from what the client had requested. I am confident that Lauren can really turn things around and become a critical player on this team, however. Her past performance was solid and she's always shown a willingness to improve.

He is not proactive about asking for extensions on deadlines, so he has blown past numerous hard deadlines that clients have given him. Moreover, it is unclear what he's spending all his time on, since the reports he finally produces are usually riddled with errors. He seems uninterested in correcting course because every time I have coached him on ways he can speak with clients to give them status updates, he has ignored me.
