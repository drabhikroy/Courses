#  Experiments and Causation 

---

#  Cause 

--

+ Variable that produces an effect or result

--

+ Most causes are **inus** - 
	
> A cause is an insufficient (**i**) 

> but non-redundant (**n**) 

> part of an unnecessary (**u**) but

> sufficient condition (**s**)

--

- A given event may have many different causes
	
--

- Many factors are required for an effect to occur, but they can rarely be fully known and how they relate to one another

---

#  Effect 

--

+ Difference between what did happen and what would have happened

--

+ This reasoning generally requires a counterfactual
	
---

#  Counterfactual 

--

+ Knowledge of what would have happened in the absence of a suspected causal agent

--

	+ Physically impossible

--

	+ Impossible to simultaneously receive and not receive a treatment
	
--

	+ Therefore, the central task of all cause-probing research is to approximate the physically impossible counterfactual

---

#  Causal Relationships

--

A causal relationship requires three conditions

--

1. Cause preceded effect (temporal precedence)

--

2. Cause and effect covary

--

3. No other plausible alternative explanations can account for a causal relationship

---

#  Cause, Effect, and Causal Relationships 

--

+ In experiments

--

	+ Presumed causes are manipulated to observe their effect

--

	+ Variability in cause related to variation in an effect

--

	+ Elements of design and extra-study knowledge are used to account for and reduce the plausibility of alternative explanations

---

#  Causation, Correlation, and Confounds 

--

+ Correlation does not prove causation

--

+ Correlations do not meet the first premise of causal logic (temporal precedence)

--

+ Such relationships are often due to a third variable (i.e., a confound)

---

#  Manipulable and Nonmanipulable Causes 

--

+ Experiments involve causal agents that can be manipulated

--

+ Nonmanipulable causes (e.g., ethnicity, gender) cannot be causes in experiments because they cannot be deliberately varied

---

#  Causal Description and Causal Explanation 

--

+ **Causal description**. identifying that a causal relationship exists between A and B

--

+ **Molar causation**. the overall relationship between a treatment package and its effects

--

+ **Causal explanation**. explaining how A causes B

--

+ **Molecular causation**. knowing which parts of a treatment are responsible for which parts of an effect

#  Modern Descriptions of Experiments 

---

#  Randomized Experiment 

--

+ Units are assigned to conditions randomly

--

+ Randomly assigned units are probabilistically equivalent based on expectancy (if certain conditions are met)
	
--

+ Under the appropriate conditions, randomized experiments provide unbiased estimates of an effect

---

#  Quasi-Experiment 

--

+ Shares all features of randomized experiments except assignment

--

+ Assignment to conditions occurs by self-selection

--

+ Greater emphasis on enumerating and ruling out alternative explanations

--

  +  ... through logic and reasoning, design, and measurement

---

#  Natural Experiment 

+ Naturally-occurring contrast between a treatment and comparison condition

--

+ Typically concern nonmanipulable causes

--

+ Requires constructing a counterfactual rather than manipulating one

---

#  Nonexperimental Designs 

+ Often called correlational or passive designs (i.e., cross-sectional)

--

+ Statistical controls often used in place of structural design elements

--

+ Generally do not support strong causal inferences

---

#  Experiments and the Generalization of Causal Connections 

---

#  Most Experiments are Local but have General Aspirations 

--

+ Most experiments are localized

--

+ Limited samples of **utos** 

> units (**u**) 

> treatments (**t**) 

> observations (**o**)

> settings (**s**)

--

+ What Campbell labeled local molar causal validity

---

#  Construct Validity: Causal Generalization as Representation 

--

+ *Premised on generalizing from particular sampled instances of units, treatments, observations, and settings to the abstract, higher order constructs that sampled instances represent*

---

#  External Validity: Causal Generalization as Extrapolation 

--

+ *Inferring a causal relationship to unsampled units, treatments, observations, and settings from sampled instances*

--

+ Enhanced when probability sampling methods are used

--

  + Broad to narrow

--

  + Narrow to broad

---

#  Approaches to Making Causal Generalizations

--

+ Sampling

--

+ Probabilistic

--

+ Heterogeneous instances

--

+ Purposive

--

+ Grounded theory

--

+ Surface similarity

--

+ Ruling out irrelevancies

--

+ Making discrimination

--

+ Interpolation and extrapolation

--

+ Casual explanation

---

# Statistical Conclusion Validity and Internal Validity 



---

#  Validity

--

+ Approximate truthfulness of correctness of an inference

--

+ Not an all or none, either or, condition, rather a matter of degree

--

+ Efforts to increase one type of validity often reduce others

---

#  Statistical Conclusion Validity

--
 

Validity of inferences about the covariation between treatment (cause) and outcome (effect)

---

#  Internal Validity

--
 
*Validity of inferences about whether observed covariation between $A$ (treatment/cause) and $B$ (outcome/effect) reflects a causal relationship from $A$ to $B$ as those variables were manipulated or measured*

---

#  Construct Validity

--

*Validity of inferences about the higher order constructs that represent sampling particulars*

---

#  External Validity 

--

*Validity of inferences about whether a cause-effect relationship holds over variations in units, treatments, observations, and settings*

---

#  Threats to Validity 

--

+ Reasons why an inference may be partly or wholly incorrect

--

+ Design controls can be used to reduce many validity threats, but not in all instances

--

+ Threats to validity are generally context-dependent

---

#  Internal Validity

--

+ *Inferences about whether the observed covariation between $A$ and $B$ reflects a causal relationship from $A$ to $B$ in the form in which the variables were manipulated or measured*

--

+ In most cause-probing studies, internal validity is the primary focus

---

#  Threats to Internal Validity (1/2)

--

+ **Ambiguous temporal precedence**. Lack of clarity about which variable occurred first may yield confusion about which variable is the cause and which is the effect

--

+ **Selection**. Systematic differences over conditions in respondent characteristics that could also cause the observed effect

--

+ **History**. Events occurring concurrently with treatment that could cause the observed effect

--

+ **Maturation**. Naturally occurring changes over time that could be confused with a treatment effect

--

+ **Regression**. When units are selected for their extreme scores, they will often have less extreme scores on other variables, an occurrence that can be confused with a treatment effect

---

#  Threats to Internal Validity (2/2)

--

+ **Attrition**. Loss of respondents to treatment or measurement can produce counterfactual effects if that loss is systematically correlated with conditions

--

+ **Testing**. Exposure to a test can affect test scores on subsequent exposures to that test, an occurrence that can be confused with a treatment effect

--

+ **Instrumentation**. The nature of a measure may change over time or conditions in a way that could be confused with a treatment effect

--

+ **Additive and interactive threats**. The impact of a threat can be added to that of another threat or may depend on the level of another threat

---

#  Estimating Internal Validity in Experiments 

--

+ By definition randomized experiments eliminate selection through random assignment to conditions

--

+ Most other threats are (should be) probabilistically distributed as well

---

#  Estimating Internal Validity in Experiments

--

+ Only two likely validity threats (typically) arise from experiments

--

  + Attrition

--

	+ Testing

---

#  Estimating Internal Validity in Quasi-Experiments

--

+ Differences between groups tend to be more systematic than random

--

+ All threats should be made explicit and then ruled out one by one
	
--

+ Once identified, threats can be systematically examined

---

#  That’s it!
