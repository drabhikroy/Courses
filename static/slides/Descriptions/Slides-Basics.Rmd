# Overview

**You can measure many things** Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. Even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized. 

When assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.

---

# Course Objectives

--

Assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices

--

Confidently determining valid and reliable measures

--

Interpret and report psychometric properties of tests

--

Recognize measurement in the evaluative process

--

Understand the methods and techniques for establishing and evaluating reliability and validity

---

# Hope

--

By the end of this course, you will hopefully become 

--

1. literate in the connection between data and measurement principles

--

2. a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across

---

# Course Materials

- [eCampus](https://ecampus.wvu.edu/) access: for submissions and grades only

- controversies in testing

--

- interpretation of test scores norms

--

--

<i>Measurement</i> 

--

  - is the determination of attributes or dimensions of an object, skill or knowledge

--

  - demands ethics and trust
